Title: Climate change: global temperature | NOAA Climate.gov
for the entire globe may seem odd. after all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on earth are likely more than 100 degrees fahrenheit ( 55 degrees celsius ) apart. temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the northern and southern hemispheres. this means that some parts of earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. to speak of the \\\" average \\\" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. however, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in earth's energy budget, which can only be directly measured from space. to calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies — the difference between the observed temperature and the long - term average temperature for each location and date. multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend. across inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and known physical relationships — such as the way temperature decreases with altitude — to estimate the missing values. each value is then used to calculate a global - scale temperature anomaly. this process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in earth's surface temperature over time. read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our climate data primer. past and future change in global temperature temperature change has not been uniform across the planet, but more areas are warming than cooling. and the rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades. according to noaa's 2024 annual climate report the combined land and ocean temperature has warmed at an average rate of 0. 11 degrees fahrenheit ( 0. 06 degrees celsius ) per decade since 1850 and more than three times that rate ( 0. 36 degrees fahrenheit, or 0. 20 degrees celsius ) per decade since 1975. according to the latest synthesis report ( pdf ) from the intergovernmental panel on climate change, there is no debate about the cause of this warming trend : human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1. 1°c above 1850 - 1900 in 2011 - 2020. in the ipcc's sixth assessment report on the physical basis of climate change, experts summarized the relative influence of all things known to affect earth's average surface temperature : the likely range of total human - caused global surface temperature increase from 1850 – 1900 to 2010 – 2019 is 0. 8°c to 1. 3°c, with a best estimate of 1. 07°c [ 2. 01 ]. over this period, it is likely that well - mixed greenhouse gases ( ghgs ) contributed a warming of 1. 0°c to 2. 0°c, and other human drivers ( principally aerosols ) contributed a cooling of 0. 0°c to 0. 8°c, natural ( solar and volcanic ) drivers changed global surface temperature by – 0. 1°c to + 0. 1°c, and internal variability changed it by – 0. 2°c to + 0. 2°c. the amount of future warming earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. today, our activities — burning fossil fuels and to a lesser extent clearing forests — add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon ( equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide ) to the atmosphere each year. because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts increase each year. according to the 2017 u. s. climate science special report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees fahrenheit warmer than the 1901 - 1960 average, and possibly as much as 10. 2 degrees warmer. if annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050, models project global temperatures would still be at least 2. 4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5. 9 degrees warmer. - climate at a glance for noaa global and national surface temperature maps, graphs, and underlying data. - maps of u. s. temperature and precipitation trends. - the climate explorer for u. s. county - level maps and time series of past and future temperatures and climate impacts. global carbon project.
