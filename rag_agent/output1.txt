Title: UIUC MCS-DS Review (2025): Cost, Acceptance Rate, and Career Outcomes
considering the university of illinois ’ online master of computer science in data science ( mcs - ds )? in this 2025 review, we break down the program ’ s cost, acceptance rate, and career outcomes — plus insights from graduates who completed the coursera - based course. the university of illinois urbana - champaign ’ s mcs - ds program offers a flexible, fully online curriculum tailored to working professionals. the program consists of 8 courses, totaling 32 credit hours, which can be completed in 12 to 36 months, depending on the student ’ s pace. delivered entirely through coursera, the program enables students to balance learning with personal and professional commitments. the mcs - ds program features a combination of core and elective courses tailored to provide a strong foundation in data science while allowing for specialization. below is a breakdown of key courses : students complete a capstone project to apply their knowledge to real - world data science problems, often in collaboration with specific industries. the ms in computer science at uic offers a project option, which is a capstone experience bridging coursework and a full thesis. the project replaces 4 credits of coursework and involves independent work, a final report, and an evaluation by the advisor and another faculty member. this option is ideal for those aiming for industry roles. included in the fortune top 10 affordable online master ’ s in data science programs, the mcs - ds is competitively priced at $ 19, 840 – $ 24, 128. the mcs - ds program offers a “ pay - as - you - go ” tuition model, allowing students to pay for their courses incrementally rather than up - front. this flexible structure makes tuition more manageable, as payments are spread out throughout the program. to be considered for the mcs - ds program, applicants must meet the following criteria : graduates of the program are well - prepared for in - demand roles such as : the program emphasizes practical, hands - on learning, which enhances employability. additionally, students join a vast alumni network of over 800, 000 members, providing access to career connections and opportunities worldwide. here are a few reasons why this is such a popular master ’ s of data science program : one potential drawback is the limited course selection. the data science track focuses on four areas : machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and cloud computing. if you ’ re looking for in - depth courses on deep learning or computer vision, you might be underwhelmed. we talked with apurva hari, a san francisco - based ai consultant currently working on the chatbot team for a large national bank. apurva was a part of the first uiuc cohort in 2016 and graduated from the program in 2018. i graduated from a college in india with a degree in computer science, and my first job was with a company called franklin templeton investments. i was a part of the security and customer experience / networks teams. i was an analyst on that team. i moved to the bay area in 2015. i took up a certification course at uc berkeley extension, big data analysis, and took courses in python programming and the fundamentals of machine learning. when i joined the master ’ s program, i worked as a lead data analyst on the data governance team at silicon valley bank. it was online and part - time. i applied to a few on - campus programs before that and was admitted, but this program allowed me to continue working while i studied. when i applied, i had to take a gre and toefl exam since i ’ m not a u. s. citizen. i had applied to other programs, so i already had those credentials. i also had to submit a statement of purpose, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and certificates. note : the gre is no longer required for the uiuc program. my coursework was primarily focused on statistics and data science. i was taking courses in statistics at a basic level, advanced stats, bayesian statistics, applied machine learning, data visualization, and data cleaning. one course that is very close to the work that i do now was text information systems ( see a sample syllabus ). this covered the basics of text mining all the way to advanced concepts like building classifiers and text retrieval algorithms. another course that was helpful was data visualization. i do a lot of data visualization at work, and in this course, i learned how to connect databases with the d3 javascript library and also worked with tableau, which i had prior experience with. these concepts have been really, really helpful. the course gave me a theoretical perspective on data visualization, as we covered things like building better dashboards, design fundamentals, and color theory. when i had completed about 75 % of the program, i started applying for jobs. and i joined wells fargo, initially on the ai team. i think part of why they hired me was this degree and my background in data science from the program. i really enjoyed the program, but if someone is going down this path, i ’ d say that it ’ s a lot of work, especially if they ’ re not from a technical background. also, if you ’ re working, you really have to know how to manage your time well. at the time, there were some technical issues with the videos and exams, but typically those were resolved. another drawback was that, at the time, they didn ’ t really have any location - based career services. as i was based in the bay area, i had to navigate the job market myself. i would also say that the course selection was limited. there ’ s a lot of helpful machine learning content, but deep learning was only touched on in a few courses. i had all the typical benefits of an on - campus master ’ s student, but they were all virtual. i had access to recorded seminars and the e - library, and one great benefit was that i received discounts for conferences. i was able to attend several conferences in the bay area. i would definitely recommend this program. the degree has helped me successfully transition to a career in data science. plus, i got the opportunity to interact and learn from a talented, motivated, and extremely supportive team of peers and staff ( professors, tas ). and the most special reason : i graduated with an advanced degree from one of the top universities for computer science ( which has been a dream ) despite having a baby around that time. while uiuc does not publish a formally verified acceptance rate for the online mcs - ds track, applicant forums suggest it is reasonably selective. for example, several admitted applicants on reddit reported being accepted with gpas below 3. 2, and estimations around ~ 30 % acceptance have circulated. because the official rate is not disclosed, prospective students should treat this figure as a rough indication, not a guarantee. yes — the program is designed with working professionals in mind. the degree is fully online, offered through coursera, and allows pacing flexibility ( typically 12 – 36 months ). it focuses on high - demand skills in machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and cloud computing, and graduates are positioned for roles such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, or analytics leader. if you already have a quantitative or technical background and seek to upskill without pausing your career, the program offers strong value. the program is competitively priced among online data science master ’ s degrees. uiuc ’ s listing shows a total cost for the online mcs ( which includes the data - science track ) at approximately us $ 19, 840 – $ 24, 864 for 32 credit hours. the “ pay - as - you - go ” model means you pay per course as you progress rather than a large upfront tuition fee, which adds flexibility for working professionals. no – the gre is not required for the online mcs or mcs - ds programs at uiuc. that said, applicants are expected to display strong quantitative and programming foundations. the admissions faq notes that while a gpa of 3. 0 ( on a 4. 0 scale ) over the last two years of undergraduate study is a campus minimum, typical admitted students often have gpas above 3. 2. applicants with weaker academic history might bolster their application with relevant work experience, strong programming credentials, or other compensating factors. graduates are equipped with skills tailored to one of today ’ s fastest - growing fields. the program description emphasizes that mcs - ds students will “ be uniquely qualified to enter one of the highest paying and in - demand career tracks in the industry. ” with the foundational curriculum aimed at machine learning, data mining, cloud computing, and data visualization, alumni report career transitions into roles such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, ai consultant, and analytics lead. while uiuc does not publish detailed cohort - by - cohort employment statistics for the online track, the skill - set alignment and reputation of the university ’ s cs department strongly support positive outcomes. the university of illinois ’ mcs - ds program offers a comprehensive, flexible online education for aspiring data scientists. with a mix of core and elective courses, students can tailor their learning while gaining practical experience through a capstone project. the program ’ s competitive pricing, flexible tuition options, and strong career prospects make it a compelling choice for professionals seeking to advance in the field of data science. all the best!\n\nTitle: Reddit -

time. i applied to a few on - campus programs before that and was admitted, but this program allowed me to continue working while i studied. when i applied, i had to take a gre and toefl exam since i ’ m not a u. s. citizen. i had applied to other programs, so i already had those credentials. i also had to submit a statement of purpose, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and certificates. note : the gre is no longer required for the uiuc program. my coursework was primarily focused on statistics and data science. i was taking courses in statistics at a basic level, advanced stats, bayesian statistics, applied machine learning, data visualization, and data cleaning. one course that is very close to the work that i do now was text information systems ( see a sample syllabus ). this covered the basics of text mining all the way to advanced concepts like building classifiers and text retrieval algorithms. another course that was helpful was data visualization. i do a lot of data visualization at work, and in this course, i learned how to connect databases with the d3 javascript library and also worked with tableau, which i had prior experience with. these concepts have been really, really helpful. the course gave me a theoretical perspective on data visualization, as we covered things like building better dashboards, design fundamentals, and color theory. when i had completed about 75 % of the program, i started applying for jobs. and i joined wells fargo, initially on the ai team. i think part of why they hired me was this degree and my background in data science from the program. i really enjoyed the program, but if someone is going down this path, i ’ d say that it ’ s a lot of work, especially if they ’ re not from a technical background. also, if you ’ re working, you really have to know how to manage your time well. at the time, there were some technical issues with the videos and exams, but typically those were resolved. another drawback was that, at the time, they didn ’ t really have any location - based career services. as i was based in the bay area, i had to navigate the job market myself. i would also say that the course selection was limited. there ’ s a lot of helpful machine learning content, but deep learning was only touched on in a few courses. i had all the typical benefits of an on - campus master ’ s student, but they were all virtual. i had access to recorded seminars and the e - library, and one great benefit was that i received discounts for conferences. i was able to attend several conferences in the bay area. i would definitely recommend this program. the degree has helped me successfully transition to a career in data science. plus, i got the opportunity to interact and learn from a talented, motivated, and extremely supportive team of peers and staff ( professors, tas ). and the most special reason : i graduated with an advanced degree from one of the top universities for computer science ( which has been a dream ) despite having a baby around that time. while uiuc does not publish a formally verified acceptance rate for the online mcs - ds track, applicant forums suggest it is reasonably selective. for example, several admitted applicants on reddit reported being accepted with gpas below 3. 2, and estimations around ~ 30 % acceptance have circulated. because the official rate is not disclosed, prospective students should treat this figure as a rough indication, not a guarantee. yes — the program is designed with working professionals in mind. the degree is fully online, offered through coursera, and allows pacing flexibility ( typically 12 – 36 months ). it focuses on high - demand skills in machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and cloud computing, and graduates are positioned for roles such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, or analytics leader. if you already have a quantitative or technical background and seek to upskill without pausing your career, the program offers strong value. the program is competitively priced among online data science master ’ s degrees. uiuc ’ s listing shows a total cost for the online mcs ( which includes the data - science track ) at approximately us $ 19, 840 – $ 24, 864 for 32 credit hours. the “ pay - as - you - go ” model means you pay per course as you progress rather than a large upfront tuition fee, which adds flexibility for working professionals. no – the gre is not required for the online mcs or mcs - ds programs at uiuc. that said, applicants are expected to display strong quantitative and programming foundations. the admissions faq notes that while a gpa of 3. 0 ( on a 4. 0 scale ) over the last two years of undergraduate study is a campus minimum, typical admitted students often have gpas above 3. 2. applicants with weaker academic history might bolster their application with relevant work experience, strong programming credentials, or other compensating factors. graduates are equipped with skills tailored to one of today ’ s fastest - growing fields. the program description emphasizes that mcs - ds students will “ be uniquely qualified to enter one of the highest paying and in - demand career tracks in the industry. ” with the foundational curriculum aimed at machine learning, data mining, cloud computing, and data visualization, alumni report career transitions into roles such as data scientist, machine learning engineer, ai consultant, and analytics lead. while uiuc does not publish detailed cohort - by - cohort employment statistics for the online track, the skill - set alignment and reputation of the university ’ s cs department strongly support positive outcomes. the university of illinois ’ mcs - ds program offers a comprehensive, flexible online education for aspiring data scientists. with a mix of core and elective courses, students can tailor their learning while gaining practical experience through a capstone project. the program ’ s competitive pricing, flexible tuition options, and strong career prospects make it a compelling choice for professionals seeking to advance in the field of data science. all the best!\n\nTitle: Index -
