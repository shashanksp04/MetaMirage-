Title: Shade-Loving Perennials | Brighten Low-Light Gardens

Why Plant Perennials For Shade?

A shady spot in your landscape offers the opportunity to grow some wonderful, unique plant selections that not only tolerate shade but actually prefer it. These include richly-colored flowers, plants with lush green foliage, flowering groundcovers, and vines that will climb and provide cover. Best of all, air temperatures in a shade garden can be 15-25 degrees cooler than in the open sun! So choose your favorites and plant a relaxing place to cool off and unwind.

Title: How to Care For Lavender In Winter For Better Blooms in Spring
it's best not to do any major pruning just before the winter dormancy season. pruning can leave the woody stems vulnerable to ice or frost damage, so it's always best to wait until spring to prune lavender. however, you can do a bit of light pruning in early autumn, avoiding the woody stems, to neaten up the plant. cut back on watering as winter approaches, cut back on the frequency of watering. your lavender plants won't need water during the dormant winter season, and too much moisture has the potential to cause root rot to occur, especially if wet soil freezes. move containers indoors if your lavender plants are in containers, moving them into a sheltered place like the garage or into a garden shed will help protect them from harsh winter conditions. avoid placing them near a drafty door or window, and place the containers near a window so they receive sunlight. if you don't have an indoor spot with windows, you can substitute a grow light to give lavender plants light exposure. wrap plants many gardeners use fabric to loosely wrap their lavender plants to protect them. lightweight, open - weave fabrics — burlap, woven cotton, or linen — work best to let light in and ensure good air circulation. add a layer of mulch adding a light layer of mulch around the base of your lavender plants will help protect the roots from freezing and rot. use a lightweight mulch like pine straw or shredded leaves to allow for some air circulation and continued soil drainage during periods of wet winter weather. use wind barriers if your lavender plants are in a spot that is exposed to harsh winds, you can place wind barriers to protect them. use lattice barriers that allow sunlight to pass through and that allow for air circulation. you can also place container plants behind hedges or taller plants to provide a windbreak. what temperature is too cool for lavender? because different varieties of lavender have different cold hardiness, their tolerance of cold differs depending on the cultivar. in general, lavender likes a temperate zone that is not too hot or too cold. english lavender is cold hardy to usda zone 5, but a bit of extra winter protection ( mulch, fabric, wind barriers ) can't hurt. french and spanish lavenders, however, are only hardy to usda zone 8. during the dormant winter season, temperatures between 40 - 60f should be fine, but if your winter temperatures frequently dip below freezing, bring your plants indoors. faq do you need to cut back lavender for winter? it's best not to cut back lavender until spring. winter is its dormant season, so allow it to naturally wind down and wait until spring for pruning, when it will stimulate fresh growth. how do you wrap lavender to prepare it for winter? wrap lavender loosely with lightweight fabric ( like burlap ), and don't tie it too tightly so it has good air circulation. explore more : gardening plants & flowers perennials lavender winter care | plant addic

User > The leaves falling from my huge oak tree, which has oak mites, have white spots and galls. Is it okay to put these fallen leaves with galls in my flower beds over winter, or should I get them out of my yard? Basically, will the leaf pests survive over winter and re-infect my oak?

Oak Tree Gall Mites: Learn How To Get Rid Of Oak Mites
Oak leaf gall mites are more of a problem for humans than for oak trees. These insects live inside the galls on oak leaves. If they leave the galls in search of other food, they can be a true nuisance. Their bites are itchy and painful. So exactly what are oak leaf mites? What is effective in treating oak mites? If you want more information on how to get rid of oak mites, also called oak leaf itch mites, read on.
What are Oak Leaf Mites?
Oak tree gall mites are tiny parasites that attack gall larvae on oak leaves. When we say tiny, we mean tiny! You may not be able to spot one of these mites without a magnifying glass. The female and male oak tree gall mites mate. Once the females are fertilized, they enter the gall and paralyze the larvae with their venom. The female mites then feed on the larvae until their offspring emerge. An entire generation of oak mites can emerge in a single week, which means that the mite population can swell rapidly. Once the oak tree gall mites have eaten the gall larvae, they leave in search of other food. Even if they don’t run out of food, mites may leave the galls. They may fall from the tree or be blown off by a breeze. This usually happens late in the season when the mite population is very large. Some 300,000 mites can fall from each tree every day.
Oak tree gall mites can enter a house through open windows or screens and bite people inside. More often, however, the mites bite people while working outdoors in the garden. The bites usually occur on the upper body or wherever clothing is loose. They are painful and itch a lot. People who are not aware of oak tree gall mites think they have been bitten by bed bugs. You might think that spraying the oak tree would be an effective oak mite control, but this is not the case. The oak tree gall mites actually live inside the galls. Since tree sprays do not penetrate the galls, the mites are safe from sprays. If you are wondering how to get rid of oak mites, there is no perfect solution. You can try to exercise oak mite control by using DEET, a commercially available mosquito and tick repellent. In the end though, you can only protect yourself best by being vigilant. Stay away from oak trees with galls toward the end of summer. When you do go into the garden or near the trees, shower and wash your clothes in hot water when you come in from gardening.

Title: Phaeolus schweinitzii - Wikipedia
Phaeolus schweinitzii Phaeolus schweinitzii, commonly known as velvet-top fungus, dyer's polypore, dyer's mazegill, or pine dye polypore, is a fungal plant pathogen. [edit] P. schweinitzii is named after Lewis David de Schweinitz, a Pennsylvania-born Moravian minister and important early American mycologist. [edit] P. schweinitzii is a polypore, although unlike bracket fungi the fruiting body may appear terrestrial when growing from the roots or base of the host tree. [1] [2] The fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow. [3] They are tannish with darker brown centres, with orange to pale margins on young specimens. [1] [4] They may grow beyond 25 centimetres (10 in) in diameter. [4] As the fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the yellow-brown flesh becomes harder and more wood-like. [3] The pores bruise brown. [1] The spores are white, elliptical, smooth, and inamyloid. [4] The effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose. Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay. Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout. [5] [edit] Similar species include Heterobasidion irregulare, H. occidentale, Inonotus dryophilus, and Onnia tomentosa. [4] Habitat and distribution P. schweinitzii causes butt rot on conifers such as Douglas-fir, spruce, fir, hemlock, pine, and larch. [6] It is native to North America and Eurasia, [6] and has been identified as an exotic species in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. [7] [edit] As its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown dye, depending on the material dyed and the mordant used. [3] [8] The species is not edible. [9] [edit] - ^ a b c Trudell, Steve; Ammirati, Joe (2009). Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest. Timber Press Field Guides. Portland, OR: Timber Press. p. 262.

User > I have an overgrown bush and am uncertain about how to trim or prune it. I do not know what type of bush it is but am attaching photos. The leaves have three lobes and reddish stems and grow in pairs, on branches clustered at the end of a larger branch. The leaves turn to a deep red or maroon color (not scarlet) in the fall. There are no flowers. Some of the central branches have died and been cut out; some more than 14 years ago and some about 3 years ago. There does not seem to be much new growth from the base. The remaining branches have spread out in an unattractive shape. Is there anything I can do to re-create an attractive shape by trimming or pruning this overgrown bush?

shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and yew, are commonly grown as formal hedges but cannot be renovated in this way. do not prune these shrubs back into dead portions of the branches, as this will create large open gaps in the hedge, and these species do not readily fill in those gaps with new growth. if these hedge species become too large or unattractive, they will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. pruning overgrown evergreen shrubs large, overgrown evergreen shrubs with scale and needle - like foliage, such as juniper and pine, and some with broad leaves, like boxwood, are a more complex problem. large evergreen shrubs possess bare or dead zones in their centers. they cannot be pruned back severely because they are incapable of initiating new growth from bare branches. this means that these shrubs can only be reduced in size to a certain extent, as they should only be pruned back to green areas. do not prune evergreen shrubs back into dead portions of the branches. any large hole or gap in the canopy revealed by pruning will always remain. large, overgrown junipers, spruces, pines, or other conifers that have become too large or unattractive will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. some species, such as yew and, to a lesser extent, boxwood and arborvitae, can initiate some new growth from bare stems and may eventually fill in, but this process can take a considerable amount of time. this means these evergreen shrubs, when severely pruned, may be unattractive for five or more years, and some may never fully fill in. often, it is best to remove and replace even these shrubs to maintain an attractive planting.

Oak leaf gall mites are more of a problem for humans than for oak trees. These insects live inside the galls on oak leaves. If they leave the galls in search of other food, they can be a true nuisance. Their bites are itchy and painful. So exactly what are oak leaf mites? What is effective in treating oak mites? If you want more information on how to get rid of oak mites, also called oak leaf itch mites, read on.
What are Oak Leaf Mites?
Oak tree gall mites are tiny parasites that attack gall larvae on oak leaves. When we say tiny, we mean tiny! You may not be able to spot one of these mites without a magnifying glass. The female and male oak tree gall mites mate. Once the females are fertilized, they enter the gall and paralyze the larvae with their venom. The female mites then feed on the larvae until their offspring emerge. An entire generation of oak mites can emerge in a single week, which means that the mite population can swell rapidly. Once the oak tree gall mites have eaten the gall larvae, they leave in search of other food. Even if they don’t run out of food, mites may leave the galls. They may fall from the tree or be blown off by a breeze. This usually happens late in the season when the mite population is very large. Some 300,000 mites can fall from each tree every day.
Oak tree gall mites can enter a house through open windows or screens and bite people inside. More often, however, the mites bite people while working outdoors in the garden. The bites usually occur on the upper body or wherever clothing is loose. They are painful and itch a lot. People who are not aware of oak tree gall mites think they have been bitten by bed bugs. You might think that spraying the oak tree would be an effective oak mite control, but this is not the case. The oak tree gall mites actually live inside the galls. Since tree sprays do not penetrate the galls, the mites are safe from sprays. If you are wondering how to get rid of oak mites, there is no perfect solution. You can try to exercise oak mite control by using DEET, a commercially available mosquito and tick repellent. In the end though, you can only protect yourself best by being vigilant. Stay away from oak trees with galls toward the end of summer. When you do go into the garden or near the trees, shower and wash your clothes in hot water when you come in from gardening.

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2
what's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such"

Title: Potato (Solanum tuberosum)-Ring Rot | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks
By P. B. Hamm and C. M. Ocamb
Cause A bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (formerly Corynebacterium sepedonicum), which overwinters in infected tubers or as a dried slime on machinery and sacks, in storage houses, etc. It does not overwinter in soil except in infected volunteer plants. Knives used during seed-cutting operations can easily spread ring rot bacteria from infected tubers to healthy tubers.
Symptom expression varies by variety. Foliage generally does not show symptoms until mid to late in the growing season. The first symptom is a shortened internode length in the terminals. These bunchy or rosetted terminals are a darker green than the rest of the plant. A pronounced yellowing occurs between leaflet veins, and the leaflet margin rolls up and becomes necrotic.
A “green wilt” also may occur with or without the above symptoms. One or more stems in a hill may show symptoms while the rest appear normal. When affected stems are cut at the ground line and squeezed, a creamy white mass of bacteria may ooze from the water-conducting tissue.
Ring rot in tubers may not develop until they have been in storage several months, or it may be present at digging or before. When infected tubers are cut near the stem end, ring rot symptoms may appear as yellow or light brown rings of cheesy consistency in the tuber's vascular ring. In advanced tuber rot, dry gray pockets of decayed tissue surround the vascular ring. Secondary rots may completely destroy the tuber, either in the soil or in storage.
Note: Plants and tubers, especially of 'Shepody', may be infected with ring rot bacteria without showing symptoms.
- Use only certified seed potatoes.
- Plant whole, single-drop seed. Avoid using picker planters because the pick spreads disease.
- Disinfect cutting knives at least three (3) times a day when cutting a single lot of potato seed. Always disinfect before cutting a new seed lot.
- Disinfect storage bins, tools, trucks, and other equipment frequently during cutting and planting operations. Always clean extensively before beginning seed handling operations at the start of the season.
Chemical control Disinfectants or fumigants with the following active ingredients are effective against bacterial ring rot. Check with your state Department of Agriculture to determine which formulations are acceptable for the area being cleaned. In general, disinfect by wetting the surface with the product for at least 10 min. Formaldehyde-based products are ineffective.
- Copper 8-Quinolinolate (PQ 80). Use a 10 % solution in a 1:200 dilution.
- Quaternary ammonium compounds at 5 oz of a 10% solution/10 gal water.
- Sodium hypochlorite in a 1,000 to 2,000 ppm chlorine solution. Ultra Clorox bleach can be used on seed potatoes and storages in Oregon, can only be used on seed potatoes as they are going through the cutting process in Washington. Check with your state Department of Agriculture to determine which formulations are acceptable for the item being cleaned.

User > I am looking for a good plant for part shade that deer don't eat. I have an area beside my patio that has a lot of Hakonechloa macra Japanese Forest Grass in it and it's dying. I think that's because it's too hot there and the moisture is variable. It certainly is not in a shady forest. I am going to pull it out. But what should I put in its place? We have a huge herd of white tail deer living with us and it has to be something they don't like. I have a Goshiki Osmanthus there that seems happy. Otherwise, the space will be empty. I would like something fairly low growing because there's a picture window right there and I like to look out from there at my garden. Do you have any suggestions?

Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
17 deer - resistant shade plants that will brighten up your garden these pretty perennials and shrubs will grow in shady spots and deer tend to leave them alone. by nicole bradley nicole bradley nicole bradley kinning is a former garden and home improvement writer for better homes & gardens, where she has also written about pets, beauty and lifestyle topics. learn about bhg's editorial process updated on february 5, 2026 reviewed by joseph tychonievich reviewed by joseph tychonievich joseph tychonievich is a gardening expert with two decades of work in horticulture, the author of three gardening books, and known for his deep knowledge of the science behind techniques for successful gardening. learn about bhg's gardening review board close credit : david mcdonald deer - resistant shade plants are a smart choice for gardens with low light and plenty of browsing deer. gardening where deer are plentiful can be challenging, especially in shady conditions. focus on plants with substantially textured leaves that may lack appeal to hungry critters, or flavors they find bitter and unappetizing. deer are also turned off by heavily scented herbs, so intermingling those with your flowering plants or choosing plants with pungent aromas will help keep them away, although no plant can be considered completely deer - resistant. 01 of 17 lily - of - the - valley bush credit : marilyn ott deer often browse many landscape plants, but lily - of - the - valley bush ( pieris spp. ) is typically left alone. this broadleaf evergreen for part shade has thick, glossy green leaves and drooping clusters of spring flowers in pink, white, or rose. you may also see it sold as andromeda. plant it where you can enjoy the blooms up close — such as in a foundation planting or in a shrub border. give it acidic soil and steady moisture ; dry soil can lead to stress and poor flowering. the flowers, leaves, and sap of the lily - of - the - valley shrub are considered highly toxic to humans and pets. so, use caution when planting this pretty shrub where children and pets play. growing conditions : slightly moist, acidic soil size : to 12 feet tall and 8 feet wide zones : 5 - 8 02 of 17 lungwort credit : david mcdonald lungwort ( pulmonaria ) is a dependable shade perennial that deer usually skip. it ’ s grown as much for its spotted or silvery leaves as for its spring flowers, which often open pink and shift to blue as they age. tuck lungwort around spring bulbs for a layered look — narcissus and scilla are especially easy partners because they bloom around the same time. growing conditions : slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 1 foot tall and 2 feet wide zones : 2 - 8 03 of 17 astilbe credit : mike jensen bring color to shady spots with the feathery flower plumes of astilbe. depending on the variety, astilbe blooms in shades of red, coral, white, lavender, or cream. its fern - like leaves also adds texture before and after flowering. for best results, keep the soil consistently moist — astilbe can struggle in dry shade. growing conditions : rich, moist, well - drained soil size : to 3 feet tall and 30 inches wide zones : 4 - 8 20 shady garden corner ideas for a vibrant shade garden 04 of 17 jack - in - the - pulpit credit : marty baldwin bursting into bloom in the early spring, jack - in - the - pulpit ( arisaema triphyllum ) is a native woodland plant that blooms in spring and handles shade well. the “ flower ” is a hooded structure ( often green or purple ) that stands out in a shade garden. red berries may follow later in the season, and the plant typically goes dormant by midsummer — so don ’ t be surprised if it disappears until next year. deer tend to avoid jack - in - the - pulpit because it contains calcium oxalate, which can irritate when eaten. jack - in - the - pulpits are toxic, especially the corms ( bulblike roots ), so exercise caution when planting these if you have pets or small children around. growing conditions : rich, damp, acidic soil size : to 2 feet tall and 18 inches wide zones : 4 - 9 05 of 17 columbine credit : andrew drake columbine ( aquilegia spp. ), adds delicate color to part shade with nodding, lanternlike blooms held on slender stems. many gardeners also find it to be a deer - resistant choice, especially once established. columbine comes in many colors and flower shapes. it can be short - lived, but it often reseeds — so you may see new seedlings pop up nearby each spring. if you want it to spread, let a few plants go to seed ; if you prefer a tidier look, remove spent flowers before they form seedpods. growing conditions : moist, well - drained soil size : to 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 this partial shade garden plan creates a colorful spot to relax 06 of 17 bergenia credit : peter krumhardt with clusters of pink spring flowers and glossy, heart - shaped leaves, bergenia is a sturdy choice for shade and part shade. it ’ s sometimes called pigsqueak because the thick leaves can squeak when rubbed. in milder climates, bergenia may stay green through winter, adding year - round texture near paths, under trees, or at the front of a border. growing conditions : rich, moist, well - drained soil size : to 18 inches tall and wide zones : 3 - 8 07 of 17 japanese painted fern credit : janet mesic mackie if deer browse your shade garden, consider japanese painted fern ( athyrium niponicum pictum ). this fern grows 12 – 18 inches tall and stands out for its silvery fronds with green and maroon tones. given time, it forms tidy clumps that slowly expand. plant it where you ’ ll notice the leaf color — along a walkway, in a woodland - style planting, or near water where the soil stays evenly moist. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 9 japanese painted fern thrives when planted in woodland gardens, near ponds and streams, along walkways, and in shaded patio gardens. 08 of 17 ligularia credit : peter krumhardt bold leaves and bright yellow flower spikes make ligularia a standout in shade. deer often pass it by, but this plant is picky about moisture. if the soil dries out — especially in summer heat — ligularia can wilt and look ragged. help it thrive by keeping the soil consistently moist and using mulch to slow evaporation. ligularia is a natural fit near water, such as along a shady stream bank, in a rain garden, or at the edge of a pond. growing conditions : grow in moisture - retentive soil and water deeply once a week size : to 4 feet tall and wide zones : 4 - 9 09 of 17 brunnera credit : john reed forsman also called siberian bugloss, brunnera ( brunnera macrophylla ) earns its keep in shade with heart - shaped leaves and sky - blue spring flowers. deer usually leave it alone. over time, brunnera forms fuller clumps and may also reseed, especially in moist, rich soil. if volunteer seedlings show up where you don ’ t want them, pull them while they ’ re small. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 30 inches wide zones : 3 - 8 show your love with these 6 heart - shape houseplants 10 of 17 oregon grape holly credit : denny schrock oregon grape holly ( mahonia aquifolium ) is a shade - loving shrub with thick, leathery leaves that have spiny edges — one reason deer tend to avoid it. in spring, it produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by blue - black berries later in the season. give this shrub room to spread slowly by runners if you ’ d like it to form a low, evergreen colony. growing conditions : slightly acidic, well - drained, moist soil size : to 3 feet tall and 5 feet wide zones : 5 - 8 if you want berries, you need to plant two or more shrubs. 11 of 17 skimmia credit : denny schrock skimmia ( skimmia spp. ) is a broadleaf evergreen that handles shade and brings spring fragrance, thanks to clusters of white flowers. on female plants, those blooms can be followed by showy red berries in fall. skimmia is also a deer - resistant shrub that works well in a foundation planting or as a low flowering hedge. for berries, plan on planting both male and female plants. the berries also attract songbirds. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 4 feet tall and wide zones : 6 - 8 12 of 17 burkwood daphne credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly over time, forming a wider patch of foliage and blooms. plant it where it has room to expand, and keep the soil slightly moist but never soggy. growing conditions : well - drained, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 frequently asked questions what are products that keep deer away from plants? some gardeners try scent - based deterrents such as blood meal or garlic placed around the garden. results vary, and you may need to reapply after rain. is there a natural deer repellant that works? some gardeners use strong - smelling, egg - based sprays as a \\\" natural \\\" repellent. if you try this approach, follow a tested recipe, reapply as needed ( especially after rain ), and avoid spraying edible parts of food crops unless the directions specifically say it ’ s safe. do motion - activated sprinklers keep deer way from plants? motion - activated sprinklers can help scare deer away, especially when you place them near the edges of the garden where deer enter. set the sensor to cover the approach path and adjust it as plants grow. explore more : gardening pest & problem fixes garden pests was this page helpful? thanks for your feedback! tell us why! other submit sources better homes & gardens is committed to using high -

User > Why are my raspberry bushes turning yellow and how can I help them? I planted 4 raspberry bushes in my yard in early June and have noticed a couple are starting to get yellow leaves near the ground. The property has clay soil and gets pretty wet from all the rain so I put sand/compost mix around the area these bushes were planted and topped it off with some pine bark and western red cedar mulch. I am looking for information on what I can do to ensure their health and make sure they last!

User > I need expert advice regarding a drainage problem with the raised beds in a semi-commercial greenhouse that I was recently hired to manage. The bottom two thirds of the bed are rock, followed by a heavy plastic barrier with 8 inches of soil on top. Water cannot drain past the plastic. I am concerned that removing the plastic will create a false water table in the rocks below. I'm also concerned that leaving it in place is preventing proper drainage. A related situation: root aeration. When the greenhouse was constructed, ventilation was installed in the rock layer for the purpose of aerating roots. Note the PVC pipe in attached pictures. The pipe runs the length of the bed, up the side of the greenhouse and vents near the ceiling. The plastic layer is functioning as a vapor barrier, so the design fails on this point. I am out of my depth with this situation and appreciate any help you can provide regarding the greenhouse raised bed drainage. I am open to the possibility of an in-person evaluation, if you feel more data is needed before providing a recommended course of action.

get the competitive edge. ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. the top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions. as a general rule, warm - season grasses only need to be watered once or twice a week. cool - season grasses require more frequent watering, up to three times a week in hot weather. turfgrass species growing in shade require less water than the same species growing in full sun. turfgrass growing on clay soils does not need to be watered as frequently as turfgrass growing on sandy soils, because clay soils retain water longer than sandy soils, and sandy soils drain water and dry out quickly. low application rates and / or division of total irrigation time into 2 or more applications per day are sometimes needed on clay soils to allow water infiltration and prevent puddling and runoff. for specific irrigation requirements for warm - and cool - season turfgrasses in various regions of california and at different sprinkler outputs, see the uc guide to healthy lawns and the lawn watering guide for california. additional resources are managing lawns in shade, managing lawns on heavy soils, and managing turfgrasses during drought. each turfgrass species has specific mowing - height requirements ( see mowing your lawn and grasscycling ). mowing some grasses too short can weaken the turfgrass and increase weed invasions. alternatively, if some grasses are not mowed short enough, the thatch layer can build up, reducing water penetration and weakening the turfgrass. mow grasses more frequently when they are actively growing. a standard guide is to remove no more than 1 / 3 of the leaf blade at each mowing. if too much is removed at one time, it can take some time for the grass to recover, giving weeds a chance to invade. lawns with weed invasions often appear uneven. mow weedy lawns frequently enough to avoid this patchy appearance and prevent flower and weed seed formation. be sure that mower blades are sharp enough so that the turfgrass is not damaged. for large areas, it is best to mow the least weedy section first and the weediest section last to avoid spreading weeds. washing the mower's deck and underside afterwards will remove weed seeds. the same applies if mowers are moved from weedy lawns to other lawns, to avoid transporting weed seeds and propagules. avoid mowing lawns when the soil is wet, such as after rain or irrigation ; moving a mower over wet soil can lead to compaction. to maintain a healthy lawn, follow fertilizing guidelines carefully. begin a regular fertilization program approximately 6 weeks after planting. in general, lawns need to be fertilized about four times a year while they are actively growing, with no more than 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application. see practical lawn fertilization for requirements for specific turfgrass species. regular thatch removal will help keep your turfgrass healthy and competitive with weeds. thatch is a layer of organic matter ( stems, stolons, roots ) that develops between the turfgrass blades and the soil surface. a thin layer of thatch is normal and even beneficial ; it can help limit weed germination. some turfgrass species, particularly warm - season creeping grasses, develop thick thatch layers that can prevent the circulation of air, water, and nutrients in the soil. generally, you should dethatch your lawn when the thatch layer is more than 1 / 2 inch thick. for some species, such as zoysiagrass, bermudagrass, or kentucky bluegrass, this may mean dethatching every year. for other species, such as tall fescue, dethatching may only be needed every 5 years or not at all. use a thatching rake on small lawns to loosen the layer of thatch. on creeping - type grass lawns, such as bermudagrass, use a verticutter or dethatcher to cut through the lawn to the soil surface. heavy traffic can compact soil over time. soil compaction restricts the flow of oxygen, water, and nutrients into the roots, causing the turfgrass to grow slowly and making it more susceptible to weed invasions. alleviate soil compaction with regular aeration. lawns on heavy clay soils or lawns with heavy foot or equipment traffic may need to be aerated several times a year while lawns with little activity may only need to be aerated once a year or less. aerators, sometimes called aerifiers, remove small cores of soil or create pores or channels in the rooting zone. a hand - held aerifier may be adequate on small lawns. for larger areas, machine - driven aerifiers are more practical and can be found at equipment rental businesses. aerate when the turfgrass is actively growing. be aware that aeration will leave temporary holes in the turf that will gradually fill in within a few weeks ; however some weed seeds may germinate in the spaces during that time. soil cores are usually left on the lawn surface and quickly break down with irrigation ; however some soil cores may contain weed seeds. in lawns that are known to be weedy, a preemergence herbicide application should be considered following aeration. controlling occasional weeds by hand pulling may be all that is necessary if you practice regular and proper maintenance procedures. hand weeding is particularly important for preventing infestations of creeping woodsorrel ( oxalis ), nutsedge, dandelion, spurge, dallisgrass, and bermudagrass. remove weeds while they are still young and before they set seed or produce rhizomes or tubers. remove small patches before they get large. making this a regular habit will greatly reduce the number of weeds in your lawn. be sure to remove the entire weed, including the root. a dandelion fork or fishtail weeder is useful for removing weeds with a thick taproot. larger patches can be dug out and the holes filled with clean soil. if your lawn is properly maintained, herbicides will generally not be necessary. when they are needed, use them as part of an integrated management program that includes good cultural maintenance practices. no single

free of weeds. this is important when planting with seed or sod. perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. for perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules ( stems, rhizomes, and tubers ). it is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules will desiccate on the soil surface. rake off and remove the propagules. if you have particularly troublesome weed problems, continue to work the soil without irrigating for several months to bring up new propagules. a few species such as field bindweed and purple nutsedge cannot be controlled in this manner. a nonselective, systemic herbicide such as glyphosate, applied when weeds are actively growing, can also be used to kill many difficult - to - control perennials, but repeat applications may be needed. soil solarization can be very effective at controlling many weed species prior to planting and is ideal for gardeners who want to avoid herbicide use. once the area is rototilled, amended, and prepared for planting, place clear polyethylene plastic 1 to 2 mils ( 0. 025 - 0. 050 mm ) thick over the moist soil surface, and cover the edges with soil to hold them in place. for best results, soil solarization must be carried out during the time of highest solar radiation — from june to august in inland california — and the tarps must remain on the infested soil for 4 to 6 weeks. solarization is less effective or ineffective in cooler coastal areas or in the shade. many annual weeds can be controlled with this method ; however, soil solarization is not as effective at controlling certain perennials such as field bindweed and nutsedge. refer to pest notes : soil solarization for more information. many soils need to be amended with organic matter or nutrients. amendments can improve drainage in clay soils or improve the water - holding capacity in sandy soils. the ability of soils to drain water and simultaneously hold enough water is extremely important in establishing the turfgrass root system and maintaining healthy lawns. lawns thrive in soils with good drainage that allow the unrestricted flow of oxygen, nutrients, and water. when adding topsoil, make sure it is from a reputable source and that it is free of rocks, weed propagules such as rhizomes or tubers, and herbicide residues. select an appropriate turfgrass species turfgrass species vary in their tolerance to extreme temperatures, shade, drought, and amount of wear. they are divided into two broad categories : cool - season and warm - season grasses, which reflect their temperature preference and periods of active growth. cool - season species such as tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and kentucky bluegrass thrive at 60 - 80°f and may become stressed or go into a semi - dormant state in periods of extreme cold or hot temperatures. they do best in northern and coastal california climates, although there are cool - season grasses grown throughout california. warm - season grasses such as bermudagrass, buffalograss, kikuyugrass, st. augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass grow best in southern california or central valley climates where summers are hot and dry and winters are relatively mild. these grasses go dormant during winter months when soil temperatures drop below 52°f and then green up in spring when soil temperatures rise. in general, cool - season grasses are less drought - tolerant and require 25 % more water than warm - season grasses grown in the same location. when planting a lawn, choose a species that best fits your specific conditions. poorly adapted species are more susceptible to weed invasions and require more intense maintenance than well - adapted species. for more information refer to the publication turfgrass selection for the home landscape, listed in references. it is essential to choose a planting time that allows the turfgrass species to establish quickly and be competitive with weeds. warm - season grasses should be planted from mid - spring to midsummer. cool - season grasses should be planted in early spring or fall. lawns will compete with weeds more effectively if established quickly. lawns established from sod have few weed problems from the moment they are planted. lawns planted from seed, stolons, or plugs can take up to 2 months to become established and are, therefore, more susceptible to weed invasions. weed management in newly planted lawns even if a planting site has been carefully prepared, some weeds will probably develop in a new lawn. remove weeds by hand as they appear. this will prevent them from producing seed and extending the invasion. properly timed irrigation, mowing, and fertilization can keep weeds under control. in the first few weeks after planting turfgrass roots are fairly short, extending only into the top few inches of soil. water lightly to keep the root zone moist without saturating the soil. once the turfgrass becomes established, encourage healthy root growth to deeper depths with deep, infrequent watering. mow new lawns for the first time when their roots are firmly planted in the soil. be sure the soil is fairly dry so that the young turfgrass is not torn from the ground. weed management in established lawns many lawns are watered incorrectly. poor irrigation practices can weaken turfgrass, allowing weeds to invade. annual bluegrass, crabgrass, dallisgrass, and nutsedge are just a few weed species that thrive in poorly irrigated lawns. to maintain a healthy lawn, uniform water coverage is needed. sprinkler heads that are broken, obstructed, or set too low or too high may not reach all areas of the lawn and can result in dry or dead spots in an otherwise healthy turfgrass. in general, deep, infrequent irrigation will encourage healthy root growth. light, frequent watering is only required when the turfgrass has just been planted and the root system is developing. watering established turfgrass lightly and frequently creates a shallow - rooted lawn, making it less durable and allowing shallow - rooted weeds such as crabgrass to get the competitive edge. ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. the top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions.

weeds can occur in all lawns but rarely become problems in well - managed, healthy turfgrass. poor maintenance practices — such as improper fertilization, watering, and mowing — can weaken turfgrass and make it susceptible to weed invasion. total eradication of weeds isn ’ t realistic or necessary for most lawns. with good management practices, a lawn can be vigorous and attractive with little or no herbicide use. why is weed identification important? - different weeds may require different management approaches. - many weed species are associated with lawn conditions, such as overwatering, compacted soil, or low fertility. identifying the weed species can give an indication of the underlying lawn care problem, which can be corrected. - for help identifying weeds, visit ipm. ucanr. edu. prevent weed invasions with proper lawn care. - choose a turfgrass species well adapted for your area or needs. - uniform water coverage is essential ; regularly check sprinkler heads and adjust if needed. - water deeply and infrequently. - when mowing, remove no more than one - third of the leaf blade. mowing height can vary depending on turfgrass species. - fertilize with 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application up to 4 times a year. - heavy traffic can compact soil ; aerate the soil when grass is actively growing. - remove thatch if it is more than half an inch thick. - identify the weed species. - determine if there is an underlying lawn care problem such as improper fertilizing, watering, and mowing, and correct it. - remove weeds by hand when they are young and before they flower, set seed, form vegetative parts, or spread into patches. - overseed, patch, or renovate problem areas within the lawn. - before using an herbicide, address the underlying reason why weeds are invading. what about pesticides? - choose a selective herbicide that is labeled for use against your problem weed and can be used without damaging your turfgrass species. - nonselective herbicides can harm desirable turfgrass and other plants. - contact herbicides damage plant tissue but don't kill plant roots. these herbicides are most successful when applied to young weeds. - for more information on herbicides available for use on lawns, see the uc ipm pest notes : weed management in lawns. download a pdf of this quick tips. descargue un pdf de estos notas breves. pest notes : introduction weeds occur in every lawn, but they seldom become problems in well - managed, vigorously growing turfgrass. proper site preparation and turfgrass selection before planting are essential to give a new lawn a healthy start. once a lawn is established, poor maintenance practices that weaken it — such as improper irrigation, fertilization, or mowing — are the primary factors likely to predispose it to weed invasion. activities that lead to compaction also contribute significantly to turfgrass stress, making it easier for weeds to invade. an integrated weed management program can reduce most weed populations to tolerable levels and prevent large, unsightly weed patches. total eradication of weeds is not a realistic or necessary goal for most lawns and park turfgrass ; however, with proper maintenance a lawn can be practically free of weeds without the extensive use of chemicals. refer to the uc guide to healthy lawns ( see references ) for

Title: Pests of Tomato | NC State Extension Publications

tomatoes are attacked by a large number of insect pests from the time plants first emerge in the seedbed until harvest. aphids, flea beetles, and leafminers threaten young transplant - bed tomatoes. in the field, flea beetles, aphids, leafminers, stink bugs, and tomato fruitworms cause minimal damage to the foliage ; however, severe damage may result either from their feeding on the fruit or by their spreading of diseases. greenhouse tomatoes have many of the same pests as field tomatoes. tiny pests such as aphids, whiteflies, leafminers, and twospotted spider mites, however, are more likely to infest greenhouse crops than beetles, grubs, or caterpillars. occasionally, moths enter through holes in screens or fans and lay eggs in greenhouses. even in screened greenhouses, tomato fruitworms and cabbage loopers may be brought into the greenhouses on plants. a. pests that feed on the upper plant - pests that mine leaves or bore into fruits or buds - tomato fruitworm ( also known as corn earworm ) — early instars are cream colored or yellowish green with few markings. later instars are green, reddish, or brown, with pale stripes and scattered black spots, moderately hairy, and up to 1 3 / 4 inches long, with three pairs of legs and five pairs of prolegs ( figure 1 ). these larvae chew holes in fruits and buds. - tobacco budworm — this caterpillar looks similar to the tomato fruitworm, except mature worms are somewhat smaller and slightly more slender than tomato fruitworms ( figure 2 ) ; in addition, the microscopic spines on the skin of tobacco budworms are more slender, longer, and occur closer to the setae ( hairs ). - tomato pinworm — tiny, yellowish - gray larvae make blotch mines in leaves. older yellow, green, or gray purple - spotted larvae grow up to 5 / 16 inch long ( figure 3 ) ; they fold leaves and web them together or bore into stems, buds, and fruit. fruits will have pinholes and discolored blotches. - vegetable leafminer — the larva is a colorless to bright - yellow maggot, up to 1 / 8 inch long, with a tapered head ( figure 4 ). larvae make serpentine mines in leaves, with each mine slightly enlarged at one end. - pests that chew holes in leaves - blister beetles — several species of slender, elongate beetles with prominent heads grow up to 3 / 4 inch long. bodies are variously colored but usually black ( figure 5a ), black with yellow margins ( figure 5b ), or black - and - yellow striped ( figure 5c ). they leave stringy, black excrement on heavily infested plants. foliage is raggedly chewed, and plants are sometimes stunted. ( for more information about blister beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - cabbage looper — this green caterpillar has longitudinal white stripes. its body is up to 1 3 / 16 inches long, tapering toward the head ( figure 6 ). it has three pairs of legs near the head and three pairs of fleshy prolegs. young larvae hang out on the undersides of leaves, consuming tender leaf tissue while leaving most veins intact. ( for more information about cabbage loopers, see “ pests of crucifers. ” ) - colorado potato beetle — these yellowish - brown, oval, convex beetles ( figure 7 ) are up to 9 / 16 inch long with five black longitudinal stripes on each wing cover and several black spots on the pronotum ( area behind the head ). they feed on leaves and terminal growth. ( for more information about colorado potato beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - flea beetles — these various species of tiny, dark - colored beetles, 1 / 8 to 3 / 16 inch long, have solid - brown to black bodies ( figure 8a ), brown bodies with dark spots ( figure 8b ), or black bodies with a pale - yellow stripe on each wing cover ( figure 8c ). their feeding leaves tiny, round holes in foliage. ( for more information about flea beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - hornworms — these green to reddish - brown caterpillars are up to 3 1 / 2 inches long with a red or black anal horn. the body has seven diagonal marks ( tobacco hornworm, figure 9b ) or eight v - shaped marks on each side ( tomato hornworm, figure 9a ) and round, black spiracles along the side of the body. hornworms strip leaves from vines and infrequently feed on fruit, leaving large, open, superficial scars. - sap - sucking pests that cause leaf discoloration, leaf or fruit deformation, or defoliation - aphids — soft - bodied, pear - shaped insects with a pair of dark cornicles and a cauda protruding from the abdomen, aphids may be winged or wingless ( most common ). they feed in colonies, causing discoloration or mottling of the foliage and excreting honeydew on which sooty mold grows. - green peach aphid — the pale - yellow to green wingless adult is almost 1 / 8 inch long ( figure 10a ). the winged adult has a dark, dorsal blotch on a yellowish - green body ( figure 10b ). the nymph has three dark lines on its abdomen ( figure 10c ). ( for more information about green peach aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - potato aphid — adults and nymphs are solid pink, mottled green - and - pink, or light green with a dark stripe. adults are a little more than 1 / 8 inch long with long, slender cornicles about twice as long as the cauda ( figure 11 ). ( for more information about potato aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - greenhouse whitefly — this white, mothlike insect is about 1 / 16 inch long. it is found in conjunction with tiny, yellow crawlers ( first instars, the only immature stage that is mobile ) ; green, oval, flattened, immobile nymphs ; or pupae ( figure 12a – f ). their feeding activity causes leaves to yellow and drop from the plant. some plants may appear stunted and cease blooming, with black, sooty mold often present on leaves. - stink bug — a green or brown shield - shaped insect, the adult is up to 3 / 4 inch long ( figure 13 ). the nymph is green with orange and black markings. stink bugs pierce buds and fruit, causing buds to drop and fruit to be deformed. ( for more information about stink bugs, see “ pests of okra. ” ) - silverleaf whitefly — the adult is slightly smaller than the greenhouse whitefly ( females are almost 1 / 16 inch long, with males smaller ) and slightly more yellow in color. it holds its wings rooflike at about a 45 - degree angle. nymphs appear glassy to opaque yellowish and have a flattened, scalelike body with the margin near the leaf surface ( figure 14a – d ). the pupa is slightly rounded, its margins slope inward, and it lacks noticeable setae. infested plants are stunted and nonreproductive with black, sooty mold present. - twospotted spider mite — tiny ( almost microscopic ) and pale to dark green, twospotted spider mites have two or four dark - colored spots. adults and nymphs have eight legs ( figure 15 ). larvae have six legs. females are oval and about 1 / 64 inch long. males are tapered toward the rear. infested foliage becomes silvery because of pale - yellow stipples. leaves eventually become pale and die. mites spin silken webs on the undersides of leaves as they feed. ( for more information about twospotted spider mites, see “ pests of beans and peas. ” ) - western flower thrips — the adult, almost 1 / 16 inch long, varies from pale yellow to dark brown and has a rounded, narrow abdomen ( figure 16 ). larvae are distinctly yellow. infested plants are distorted and have a silvery appearance. western flower thrips are an important vector of tomato spotted wilt virus. - aphids — soft - bodied, pear - shaped insects with a pair of dark cornicles and a cauda protruding from the abdomen, aphids may be winged or wingless ( most common ). they feed in colonies, causing discoloration or mottling of the foliage and excreting honeydew on which sooty mold grows. b. pests that feed on roots or lower stems - cutworm — this fat, basically gray, brown, or black caterpillar is 1 5 / 8 to 2 inches long when fully grown, with three pairs of legs near the head and five pairs of fleshy prolegs ( figure 17 ). they are active at night. the young caterpillar climbs on leaves, and the older caterpillar severs seedling stems near the ground. they hide during the day in soil burrows at the bases of"

User: Is this an African killer bee in St Paul? Can you identify this bee/hornet/wasp? Never seen anything like it before. It was large, fast, and aggressive. Not at all like our local wasps or hornets, neither in behavior nor appearance. This is the best still I was able to get from a six second video I took after observing this unfamiliar creature; I had to run from it as it quickly became aggressive after I got too close. It disappeared after using wasp spray foam.

Title: Africanized bee - Wikipedia
spreads through florida, a densely populated state, officials worry that public fear may force misguided efforts to combat them : news reports of mass stinging attacks will promote concern and in some cases panic and anxiety, and cause citizens to demand responsible agencies and organizations to take action to help ensure their safety. we anticipate increased pressure from the public to ban beekeeping in urban and suburban areas. this action would be counter - productive. beekeepers maintaining managed colonies of domestic european bees are our best defense against an area becoming saturated with ahb. these managed bees are filling an ecological niche that would soon be occupied by less desirable colonies if it were vacant. — florida african bee action plan [ 47 ] [ edit ]  killer bee  is a term frequently used in media such as movies that portray aggressive behavior or actively seeking to attack humans.  africanized honey bee  is considered a more descriptive term in part because their behavior is increased defensiveness compared to european honey bees that can exhibit similar defensive behaviors when disturbed. [ clarification needed ] [ 48 ] the sting of the africanized honey bee is no more potent than any other variety of honey bee, and although they are similar in appearance to european honey bees, they tend to be slightly smaller and darker in color. although africanized honey bees do not actively search for humans to attack, they are more dangerous because they are more easily provoked, quicker to attack in greater numbers, and then pursue the perceived threat farther, for as much as a quarter of a mile ( 400 metres ). [ 1 ] while studies have shown that africanized honey bees can infiltrate european honey bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen ( thus usurping the hive ), this is less common than other methods. wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth ( periods when plants are not flowering ), but this behavior should not be confused with the aforementioned activity. the most common way that a european honey bee hive will become africanized is through crossbreeding during a new queen's mating flight. studies have consistently shown that africanized drones are more numerous, stronger and faster than their european cousins and are therefore able to out - compete them during these mating flights. the result of mating between africanized drones and european queens is almost always africanized offspring. [ 49 ] impact on apiculture [ edit ] in areas of suitable temperate climate, the survival traits of africanized honey bee colonies help them outperform european honey bee colonies. they also return later and work under conditions that often keep european honey bees hive - bound. this is the reason why they have gained a reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their european counterparts. studies show that in areas of florida that contain africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. [ 50 ] it is also becoming apparent that africanized honey bees have another advantage over european honey bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues, including parasites such as varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood, and even the mysterious colony collapse disorder which was plaguing beekeepers in the early 2000s. despite all its negative factors, it is possible that the africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.

oval, flattened pupa is pale green ( healthy ) or black ( parasitized ), with long hairs on its back and a fringe of short hairs around its body margin ( figure 20f ). after the adult has emerged, a white, almost - transparent pupal skin is left behind. distribution — greenhouse whiteflies are worldwide pests of greenhouse - grown ornamentals and vegetables. first discovered in england in 1856, they were found in the northeastern united states in 1870. tropical central america or south america are suggested origins of the greenhouse whitefly. host plants — greenhouse whiteflies infest a wide variety of ornamental and vegetable crops, and they can survive outdoors during the growing season, particularly in sheltered locations. some of the more important hosts besides tomato include bean, cucumber, eggplant, grape, lettuce, melon, potato, squash, strawberry, and tobacco. even trees, such as avocado, may be infested. damage — nymphs and adults extract plant sap through their needlelike mouthparts, with the adults preferring to feed on tender new growth. as a result, leaves turn yellow and drop from infested plants. in addition to having an unthrifty appearance, plants may be stunted and cease flowering. sooty mold often grows on leaves covered with honeydew secreted by whiteflies and interferes further with the growth of plants. life history — greenhouse whiteflies reproduce relatively slowly ( one generation every 30 to 45 days ), but each female lays about 250 eggs and lives as long as two months. adults usually are found on the lower surface of new leaves ( figure 21 ). there, they insert their eggs, which hatch five to seven days later. new crawlers move about the plant for a day or two, often from leaf to leaf, before inserting their mouthparts to feed. once this occurs, they probably do not move again until mature. the crawlers molt into later nymphal instars and then into pupae. finally, a new generation of whitish - yellow adults emerges. they soon are covered with a fine, white, waxy powder. parasitic wasps, encarsia formosa, sometimes help keep greenhouse whitefly populations under control. at temperatures below 75°f, the reproduction of these wasps is inhibited. as a result, whitefly infestations are favored by lower greenhouse temperatures. control of whiteflies is difficult because the eggs and immature forms are resistant to many aerosol and insecticide sprays. it is necessary to regularly apply pesticides to control emerging adults until the last of an entire generation of immature whiteflies has emerged. for specific chemical control recommendations, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta ( linnaeus ), sphingidae, lepidoptera tomato hornworm, manduca quinquemaculata ( haworth ), sphingidae, lepidoptera adult — hornworm moths have a wingspan of 4 to 5 inches. tobacco hornworm moths are slate brown ; tomato hornworm moths are ash gray. tobacco hornworm moths have six orange spots on each side of the abdomen ( figure 22a ) ; tomato hornworm moths have five similar, but less distinct, spots on each side ( figure 22e ). the wavy lines on the hind wings of the tomato hornworm are more distinct and jagged than the lines on the hind wings of the tobacco hornworm moth. egg —"

Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly"

Title: How to Prune Japanese Maples - PlantingTree
\n\nsunny days, as it causes more shock damage to the tree. with respect to timing, one question we commonly get is whether or not you can prune in the spring and fall. the answer is yes you can, however, it ’ s a good practice to be cautious when pruning at these times. pruning too heavily in the spring can cause damage to new buds and stunt growth. whereas pruning too late in the season can stimulate new growth which can be quickly damaged by freezing late fall temperatures where to cut when pruning the purpose of pruning is to encourage your tree ’ s natural growth habit. that being said, there are 5 types of branches you may want to consider removing from your japanese maple. - broken, diseased, or dead branches. these need to go for obvious reasons. prune them when you see them, no matter the time of year. - branches growing inward or in the wrong direction. while strange - looking branches can add character to a tree, they can also cause a lot of problems, particularly if they are growing inward. - crossing branches can result in damage to both the bark and the branches. this can encourage disease and pests, which is something you don ’ t want. if you find that you have several branches crossing in one area, you may consider removing a branch or two. - narrow crotches. this is where two branches meet at an angle of less than 45 degrees. remove one of the branches to open up your tree and reduce the possibility of breakage. - crowded branches. removing crowded branches is most important when it involves the crown of the tree. when you remove crowded branches and foliage in this area, it will increase airflow and help your tree breathe better. you can thin these areas by removing one out of every four branches or so. pruning tips & tricks where you cut matters when removing an entire branch, prune at a 45 - degree angle back to the branch collar, but not into it. basically, there shouldn ’ t be much of the branch left but you should never cut flush to the connecting branch or trunk. be sure to use clean, professional pruners for the best results. - do not prune young trees unless absolutely necessary. allow your tree to fully develop and grow into itself for 10 to 15 years before you do any serious pruning. - younger trees often get long, thin, whip - like branches. you may be tempted to prune off these scrawny long branches. however, it ’ s better if you don ’ t. be patient. they will fill out and get lateral branches. if you prune them off you are more likely to get even more of this same branch type. - don ’ t buy a japanese maple that grows too tall for the spot you have chosen. pruning japanese maples to control height is a fight you won ’ t win. it will only encourage faster growth and thinner, weaker branches. - do not prune off more than of the foliage or the crown of your japanese maple. - never over - prune. while aesthetic pruning of japanese maples is certainly an acceptable practice, we advise that you prune when necessary. believe it or not, sometimes less really is more. now you know how to prune japanese maples. just remember to be patient, take your time, and a little pruning maintenance can go a long way. plantingtree has many japanese maple varieties to choose from. from the bloodgood japanese maple to the coral bark maple and the orangeola, shop our premium hand -

third of the plant. you can trim less than that ’ s all that is needed, but avoid doing more unless your plant has been neglected for years and needs a major refresh. make cuts at an angle of about 45 degrees and about 0. 25 inch ( 0. 5 cm ) above a leaf node. if your shrub is already mostly upright, make cuts above leaf nodes that face outwards. if the shrub has horizontal growth that you want to train upwards, cut above inward - facing leaf nodes. you can direct a new branch to grow to the left or right by cutting above a node on the left side of a branch or on the right side, respectively. avoid making too many inward - facing cuts. this directs growth toward the center of the plant, which can help you get an upright structure, but which can also cause too much dense growth in the center. this can reduce airflow and promote common hibiscus diseases. when choosing stems to trim, look for the longest ones. trim them at a node that is about one - third of the way down the stem. choose strategically to create a shape that will be even and neat. for example, if you have more growth on one side of the shrub, making it appear lopsided, make more cuts on that side. different ways to prune hibiscus depending on your plant's needs and your own desired look, there are a few different techniques for pruning hibiscus : - some light pruning will encourage more flowers to grow on your hibiscus. to do this, pinch off growing tips in the spring and even into summer. pinch off about 0. 25 to 1 inch ( 0. 5 to 2. 5 cm ) of growth. this is an especially useful type of pruning for young plants, as it will train them to grow fuller and in an even shape. - for a full prune, cut each stem back by about a third to two or three nodes. this will promote branching, blooming, and a pleasing shape. however, blooming will be delayed till the new growth forms. - for selective pruning, only remove one - third or less of the stems from the base. this will allow some stems to continue blooming, while the rest are developing. - if you have an old, neglected hibiscus shrub, you can cut more severely. trim all of the stems down to about 1 foot ( 30 cm ) off the ground to encourage new, healthier growth. be sure the remaining stems have some leaves on them. trimming hibiscus into a tree hibiscus is a shrub, but with the right pruning, you can prune your shrub into a small tree. look for one large, strong stem to use as the “ trunk ” of the tree. it should be at least 2 feet ( 0. 6 m ) tall. trim it off by about 2 inches ( 5 cm ) and then trim back all the lower branches. trim back all the upper stems on your primary trunk to create a ball shape on the top. this will be the top of your tree. make sure these stems still have two or three nodes after trimming and that they are about 6 inches ( 30 cm ) long. maintain the shape by trimming off lower branches as they form. pruning hibiscus is a necessary garden chore, but you don ’ t have to do it every year. prune lightly for more flowers and to remove any damaged or dead branches yearly, and do a more vigorous pruning every few years for the best results. frequently asked questions do you need to cut back hibiscus every year? if you have a containerized hibiscus that you overwinter indoors, it will benefit from annual pruning. if your hibiscus shrubs are outdoors year - round and they did not suffer any frost damage, you can decide if you want to skip pruning that year. can you prune hibiscus in summer? you can pinch off the tips in summer to encourage fullness and you can “ fix ” any protruding stems that look awkward by cutting them back. you also can lightly shape the plant if needed. shop pruning essentials make the perfect cut for quick & easy cleanup mary ellen ellis has been gardening for over 20 years. with degrees in chemistry and biology, mary ellen's specialties are flowers, native plants, and herbs. -

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly over time, forming a wider patch of foliage and blooms. plant it where it has room to expand, and keep the soil slightly moist but never soggy. growing conditions : well - drained, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 frequently asked questions what are products that keep deer away from plants? some gardeners try scent - based deterrents such as blood meal or garlic placed around the garden. results vary, and you may need to reapply after rain. is there a natural deer repellant that works? some gardeners use strong - smelling, egg - based sprays as a \\\" natural \\\" repellent. if you try this approach, follow a tested recipe, reapply as needed ( especially after rain ), and avoid spraying edible parts of food crops unless the directions specifically say it ’ s safe. do motion - activated sprinklers keep deer way from plants? motion - activated sprinklers can help scare deer away, especially when you place them near the edges of the garden where deer enter. set the sensor to cover the approach path and adjust it as plants grow. explore more : gardening pest & problem fixes garden pests was this page helpful? thanks for your feedback! tell us why! other submit sources better homes & gardens is committed to using high - quality, reputable sources — including peer - reviewed studies — to support the facts in our articles. read about our editorial policies and standards to learn more about how we fact check our content for accuracy. pieris japonica. north carolina extension gardener plant toolbox. andromeda japonica. aspca. jack - in - the - pulpit. aspca jack - in - the - pulpit poisoning. national library of medicine daphne x burkwoodii. north carolina state university extension gardner toolbox. aesculus parviflora. north carolina state extension.

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

User > A year ago we bought a strawberry hydrangea tree. We planted it in a pot because we didn't have time to plant it in the ground so it could overwinter. Now, the hydrangea tree has almost no leaves, only up to the tips of the branches. Can we still plant it in the ground so that it recovers its green leaves and possibly blooms?

what's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the

##er — this green caterpillar has longitudinal white stripes. its body is up to 1 3 / 16 inches long, tapering toward the head ( figure 6 ). it has three pairs of legs near the head and three pairs of fleshy prolegs. young larvae hang out on the undersides of leaves, consuming tender leaf tissue while leaving most veins intact. ( for more information about cabbage loopers, see “ pests of crucifers. ” ) - colorado potato beetle — these yellowish - brown, oval, convex beetles ( figure 7 ) are up to 9 / 16 inch long with five black longitudinal stripes on each wing cover and several black spots on the pronotum ( area behind the head ). they feed on leaves and terminal growth. ( for more information about colorado potato beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - flea beetles — these various species of tiny, dark - colored beetles, 1 / 8 to 3 / 16 inch long, have solid - brown to black bodies ( figure 8a ), brown bodies with dark spots ( figure 8b ), or black bodies with a pale - yellow stripe on each wing cover ( figure 8c ). their feeding leaves tiny, round holes in foliage. ( for more information about flea beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - hornworms — these green to reddish - brown caterpillars are up to 3 1 / 2 inches long with a red or black anal horn. the body has seven diagonal marks ( tobacco hornworm, figure 9b ) or eight v - shaped marks on each side ( tomato hornworm, figure 9a ) and round, black spiracles along the side of the body. hornworms strip leaves from vines and infrequently feed on fruit, leaving large, open, superficial scars. - sap - sucking pests that cause leaf discoloration, leaf or fruit deformation, or defoliation - aphids — soft - bodied, pear - shaped insects with a pair of dark cornicles and a cauda protruding from the abdomen, aphids may be winged or wingless ( most common ). they feed in colonies, causing discoloration or mottling of the foliage and excreting honeydew on which sooty mold grows. - green peach aphid — the pale - yellow to green wingless adult is almost 1 / 8 inch long ( figure 10a ). the winged adult has a dark, dorsal blotch on a yellowish - green body ( figure 10b ). the nymph has three dark lines on its abdomen ( figure 10c ). ( for more information about green peach aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - potato aphid — adults and nymphs are solid pink, mottled green - and - pink, or light green with a dark stripe. adults are a little more than 1 / 8 inch long with long, slender cornicles about twice as long as the cauda ( figure 11 ). ( for more information about potato aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - greenhouse whitefly — this white, mothlike insect is about 1 / 16 inch long. it is found in conjunction with tiny, yellow crawlers ( first instars, the only immature stage that is mobile ) ; green, oval, flattened, immobile nymphs ; or pupae ( figure

Title: Pests of Tomato | NC State Extension Publications
. damage to leaves and vines is of little importance, but injury to the fruit can cause a substantial loss. life history — in mexico, california, florida, and texas, tomato pinworms overwinter outdoors as pupae at or near the soil surface. in north carolina and most other states, pinworms spend winter in greenhouses. the nocturnal moths may emerge as early as march or april. eggs are usually deposited on the undersides of leaves and hatch about one week later. during summer, larvae mine the leaves for about six days and then fold leaves or bore into fruit for another six days. mature fourth - instar larvae either remain in folded leaves or drop to the soil to pupate. about 12 days later, a new generation of moths emerges. in summer, a generation can be completed every 26 to 34 days. in cooler weather, the life cycle is longer. seven to eight overlapping generations occur each year in florida. it is probable that just as many generations occur in north carolina greenhouses. if moths escape outdoors, several generations may occur in field tomatoes during summer. sanitation and prevention are good control measures for tomato pinworms. infestations usually result from transplants that are shipped in or grown in local greenhouses. therefore, close inspection of new plants can prevent serious problems later in the season. for recommended insecticides and rates, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. liriomyza sativae blanchard, agromyzidae, diptera adult — this shiny, black fly has variable yellow markings and is almost 1 / 16 inch long ( figure 28a ). egg — the extremely small, white, oval egg is sometimes visible through the upper epidermis of the leaf via a magnifying glass ( figure 28b ). larva — the newly hatched larva is nearly colorless and very small ( but visible with a magnifying glass ). the fully grown maggot, about 1 / 8 inch long, has a translucent, bright - yellow body and black mouthparts. each maggot has a slightly pointed head and a rounded abdomen ( figure 28c ). puparium — the flattened, segmented puparium is bright yellow at first but gradually turns brown. it is oblong - oval in shape and a little more than 1 / 16 inch long ( figure 28d ). distribution — the vegetable leafminer is found from the tropics into the southeastern and southwestern united states. it occurs at least as far north as tennessee and ohio. because this leafminer has long been confused with closely related species, the precise extent of its distribution is not known. host plants — closely related to the serpentine leafminer that feeds almost exclusively on crucifers, the vegetable leafminer infests a wide variety of plants. in addition to tomato, weed and cultivated crop hosts include squash, okra, pea, bean, cabbage, turnip, potato, tobacco, cotton, radish, spinach, watermelon, beet, pepper, alfalfa, clover, vetch, and plantain. damage — like serpentine leafminers, vegetable leafminers create light - colored, irregularly winding mines in leaves. the mines are generally s - shaped and may be enlarged at one end ( figure 28e ). infested leaves are favorable habitats for bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. also, because heavily mined leaves may have much of their mesophyll ( internal tissue ) removed, photosynthetic efficiency is greatly reduced ( figure 29 ). severe infestations may cause the foliage to turn brown and appear burned. damaging infestations are most likely to occur after crops have been treated weekly with insecticides such as methomyl or carbaryl. these pesticides kill parasitic wasps that usually keep the leafminer populations at acceptable levels. life history — vegetable leafminers feed and breed year - round in the southern areas of florida and texas. in north carolina, they overwinter in soil as pupae. generally, adult flies that emerge in april or may live only four to ten days. after mating, females insert eggs into leaf tissue from the underside of the leaf. eggs hatch three to eight days later, and young larvae begin feeding, each one creating its own mine. although the leaf - mining stage may last up to twelve days, it is usually completed in four to five days during summer. larvae pupate for about 10 days ( longer in spring and fall ) at the enlarged ends of the mines or in soil. a new generation is produced about every 23 days. at least five generations occur each year in southern states. the number is higher in the tropics and in greenhouses. on a small scale, it is practical to remove infested tomato leaves to help keep leafminer populations in check. economically significant leafminer damage rarely occurs on tomatoes. for large - scale producers, insecticides remain the most reliable method of controlling infestations. for recommended insecticides and rates, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. western flower thrips frankliniella occidentalis ( pergande ), thripidae, thysanoptera adult — the western flower thrips ( figure 30a ) is almost 1 / 16 inch long, with the female larger than the male. the female varies from yellow to dark - brown and has a plump abdomen. the male is always pale yellow and has a narrower abdomen. egg — yellowish eggs cannot be seen easily because they are inserted into the plant tissue ( figure 30b ). larva — the larvae develop through two instars and are distinctly yellow. first instars ( figure 30c ) are noticeably smaller than second instars. second instars ( figure 30d ) are about the same size as adult females, and they become whitish before molting. prepupa and pupa — both prepupa ( figure 30e ) and pupa ( figure 30f ) are quiescent, nonfeeding stages. they are yellowish. antennae of prepupae protrude forward, whereas antennae of pupae are folded back over the head. prepupae have noticeable wing pads on the thorax. wing pads of pupae extend back along the abdomen. distribution — before 1980, the distribution was thought to be limited to west of the mississippi river. however, the western flower thrips has become the most prevalent thrips species attacking greenhouse plants throughout the united states

shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and yew, are commonly grown as formal hedges but cannot be renovated in this way. do not prune these shrubs back into dead portions of the branches, as this will create large open gaps in the hedge, and these species do not readily fill in those gaps with new growth. if these hedge species become too large or unattractive, they will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. pruning overgrown evergreen shrubs large, overgrown evergreen shrubs with scale and needle - like foliage, such as juniper and pine, and some with broad leaves, like boxwood, are a more complex problem. large evergreen shrubs possess bare or dead zones in their centers. they cannot be pruned back severely because they are incapable of initiating new growth from bare branches. this means that these shrubs can only be reduced in size to a certain extent, as they should only be pruned back to green areas. do not prune evergreen shrubs back into dead portions of the branches. any large hole or gap in the canopy revealed by pruning will always remain. large, overgrown junipers, spruces, pines, or other conifers that have become too large or unattractive will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. some species, such as yew and, to a lesser extent, boxwood and arborvitae, can initiate some new growth from bare stems and may eventually fill in, but this process can take a considerable amount of time. this means these evergreen shrubs, when severely pruned, may be unattractive for five or more years, and some may never fully fill in. often, it is best to remove and replace even these shrubs to maintain an attractive planting.

User > Keep or toss the two Coral bells? I have two Coral bell’s that I left in pots over winter. I noticed today it looks like there are aphids on the bottom leaves. They may not be alive, but I’m worried about planting new Coral bells and other plants in that same pot. Do you recommend getting rid of the old plants if there’s any suspicion of aphids? Or can I treat them with neem oil and all shall be well?

Title: Insects on Coral Bells - Ask Extension
Insects on Coral Bells #325283

Douglas County Oregon
Aphids feed on a wide variety of garden plants. Aphids are slow moving, soft bodied sucking insects that usually appear in clusters on new growth. More than 1,300 native species of aphids inhabit North America. They come in a wide range of colors from black to pink to white and pale green, and measure 1/16-1/4 inch long. Aphids are pear shaped and usually wingless, with two tubes, called cornicles, at the posterior end. Aphids cluster on leaves and stems, where they suck sap, causing curling and cupping of leaves. Severe infestations cause general loss of plant vigor and stunting, with reduced yields. Aphids excrete excess sugars and sap in a liquid called honeydew. This honeydew attracts ants and an air borne fungus called sooty mold. The ants feed on the honeydew. This food source is so valuable that some species of ants tend the aphids, and even take them into their shelters over winter. Such ants tend to aggravate the aphid problem, distributing them to new plants. Aphid populations can explode because of the insect’s ability to reproduce parthenogenetically (without fertilization). After one or two generations, winged aphids are born, and these fly off to other plants. When male and females mate towards the end of the season, eggs are produced, enabling the insect to overwinter.
Aphids usually appear as the weather begins to warm; they will first be noticed on plant tips, near opening flower and leaf buds. It is a good practice to monitor susceptible plants, and then at first sight simply wash off the plants with a stiff jet of water. Cradle the plant tips in your hand as you wash off the pests. Sticky honeydew and sooty mold and be washed off with a mild soap and water rinse. These two methods are especially recommended for aphid attacks on edible plants. Adult aphids can also be killed by spraying plants with insecticidal soap or with the botanical insecticide neem. Take care to apply these treatments to the stems and the undersides of leaves. Severely infected annuals may not recover from aphid attack; it is perhaps better to dig these out and dispose of them.
Releasing predator insects such as ladybugs and lacewings can be effective in reducing aphid infestations in the spring.
Aphids are attracted to the color yellow, and this can be used against them. Bright yellow plastic dishpans make a good trap when filled with soapy water and set near infested or vulnerable plants.
Properly fed plants tend to be less troubled by aphids. Too much nitrogen can be as bad as too little. Take care to use a well balanced fertilizer and water your plants regularly. Apply thick mulch in the summer to keep soil cool and moist.
Try neem oil for spider mites."
