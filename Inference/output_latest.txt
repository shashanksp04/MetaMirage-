Title: Shade-Loving Perennials | Brighten Low-Light Gardens

Why Plant Perennials For Shade?

A shady spot in your landscape offers the opportunity to grow some wonderful, unique plant selections that not only tolerate shade but actually prefer it. These include richly-colored flowers, plants with lush green foliage, flowering groundcovers, and vines that will climb and provide cover. Best of all, air temperatures in a shade garden can be 15-25 degrees cooler than in the open sun! So choose your favorites and plant a relaxing place to cool off and unwind.

Title: How to Care For Lavender In Winter For Better Blooms in Spring
it's best not to do any major pruning just before the winter dormancy season. pruning can leave the woody stems vulnerable to ice or frost damage, so it's always best to wait until spring to prune lavender. however, you can do a bit of light pruning in early autumn, avoiding the woody stems, to neaten up the plant. cut back on watering as winter approaches, cut back on the frequency of watering. your lavender plants won't need water during the dormant winter season, and too much moisture has the potential to cause root rot to occur, especially if wet soil freezes. move containers indoors if your lavender plants are in containers, moving them into a sheltered place like the garage or into a garden shed will help protect them from harsh winter conditions. avoid placing them near a drafty door or window, and place the containers near a window so they receive sunlight. if you don't have an indoor spot with windows, you can substitute a grow light to give lavender plants light exposure. wrap plants many gardeners use fabric to loosely wrap their lavender plants to protect them. lightweight, open - weave fabrics — burlap, woven cotton, or linen — work best to let light in and ensure good air circulation. add a layer of mulch adding a light layer of mulch around the base of your lavender plants will help protect the roots from freezing and rot. use a lightweight mulch like pine straw or shredded leaves to allow for some air circulation and continued soil drainage during periods of wet winter weather. use wind barriers if your lavender plants are in a spot that is exposed to harsh winds, you can place wind barriers to protect them. use lattice barriers that allow sunlight to pass through and that allow for air circulation. you can also place container plants behind hedges or taller plants to provide a windbreak. what temperature is too cool for lavender? because different varieties of lavender have different cold hardiness, their tolerance of cold differs depending on the cultivar. in general, lavender likes a temperate zone that is not too hot or too cold. english lavender is cold hardy to usda zone 5, but a bit of extra winter protection ( mulch, fabric, wind barriers ) can't hurt. french and spanish lavenders, however, are only hardy to usda zone 8. during the dormant winter season, temperatures between 40 - 60f should be fine, but if your winter temperatures frequently dip below freezing, bring your plants indoors. faq do you need to cut back lavender for winter? it's best not to cut back lavender until spring. winter is its dormant season, so allow it to naturally wind down and wait until spring for pruning, when it will stimulate fresh growth. how do you wrap lavender to prepare it for winter? wrap lavender loosely with lightweight fabric ( like burlap ), and don't tie it too tightly so it has good air circulation. explore more : gardening plants & flowers perennials lavender winter care | plant addic

User > The leaves falling from my huge oak tree, which has oak mites, have white spots and galls. Is it okay to put these fallen leaves with galls in my flower beds over winter, or should I get them out of my yard? Basically, will the leaf pests survive over winter and re-infect my oak?

Oak Tree Gall Mites: Learn How To Get Rid Of Oak Mites
Oak leaf gall mites are more of a problem for humans than for oak trees. These insects live inside the galls on oak leaves. If they leave the galls in search of other food, they can be a true nuisance. Their bites are itchy and painful. So exactly what are oak leaf mites? What is effective in treating oak mites? If you want more information on how to get rid of oak mites, also called oak leaf itch mites, read on.
What are Oak Leaf Mites?
Oak tree gall mites are tiny parasites that attack gall larvae on oak leaves. When we say tiny, we mean tiny! You may not be able to spot one of these mites without a magnifying glass. The female and male oak tree gall mites mate. Once the females are fertilized, they enter the gall and paralyze the larvae with their venom. The female mites then feed on the larvae until their offspring emerge. An entire generation of oak mites can emerge in a single week, which means that the mite population can swell rapidly. Once the oak tree gall mites have eaten the gall larvae, they leave in search of other food. Even if they don’t run out of food, mites may leave the galls. They may fall from the tree or be blown off by a breeze. This usually happens late in the season when the mite population is very large. Some 300,000 mites can fall from each tree every day.
Oak tree gall mites can enter a house through open windows or screens and bite people inside. More often, however, the mites bite people while working outdoors in the garden. The bites usually occur on the upper body or wherever clothing is loose. They are painful and itch a lot. People who are not aware of oak tree gall mites think they have been bitten by bed bugs. You might think that spraying the oak tree would be an effective oak mite control, but this is not the case. The oak tree gall mites actually live inside the galls. Since tree sprays do not penetrate the galls, the mites are safe from sprays. If you are wondering how to get rid of oak mites, there is no perfect solution. You can try to exercise oak mite control by using DEET, a commercially available mosquito and tick repellent. In the end though, you can only protect yourself best by being vigilant. Stay away from oak trees with galls toward the end of summer. When you do go into the garden or near the trees, shower and wash your clothes in hot water when you come in from gardening.

Title: Phaeolus schweinitzii - Wikipedia
Phaeolus schweinitzii Phaeolus schweinitzii, commonly known as velvet-top fungus, dyer's polypore, dyer's mazegill, or pine dye polypore, is a fungal plant pathogen. [edit] P. schweinitzii is named after Lewis David de Schweinitz, a Pennsylvania-born Moravian minister and important early American mycologist. [edit] P. schweinitzii is a polypore, although unlike bracket fungi the fruiting body may appear terrestrial when growing from the roots or base of the host tree. [1] [2] The fruiting bodies, appearing in late summer or fall, commonly incorporate blades of grass, twigs, or fallen pine needles as they grow. [3] They are tannish with darker brown centres, with orange to pale margins on young specimens. [1] [4] They may grow beyond 25 centimetres (10 in) in diameter. [4] As the fruiting bodies age, the pore surface turns from yellow to greenish yellow, the top becomes darker, and the yellow-brown flesh becomes harder and more wood-like. [3] The pores bruise brown. [1] The spores are white, elliptical, smooth, and inamyloid. [4] The effect, impact and significance of infection by this fungus is rooted in the fact that it causes brown rot, which degrades the cellulose. Thus there is a loss of tensile strength which often leads to brittle fracture near the stem base, even at a fairly early stage of decay. Decay initiated above ground can lead to branch snap or breakout. [5] [edit] Similar species include Heterobasidion irregulare, H. occidentale, Inonotus dryophilus, and Onnia tomentosa. [4] Habitat and distribution P. schweinitzii causes butt rot on conifers such as Douglas-fir, spruce, fir, hemlock, pine, and larch. [6] It is native to North America and Eurasia, [6] and has been identified as an exotic species in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. [7] [edit] As its common name suggests, the dyer's polypore is an excellent natural source of green, yellow, gold, or brown dye, depending on the material dyed and the mordant used. [3] [8] The species is not edible. [9] [edit] - ^ a b c Trudell, Steve; Ammirati, Joe (2009). Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest. Timber Press Field Guides. Portland, OR: Timber Press. p. 262.

User > I have an overgrown bush and am uncertain about how to trim or prune it. I do not know what type of bush it is but am attaching photos. The leaves have three lobes and reddish stems and grow in pairs, on branches clustered at the end of a larger branch. The leaves turn to a deep red or maroon color (not scarlet) in the fall. There are no flowers. Some of the central branches have died and been cut out; some more than 14 years ago and some about 3 years ago. There does not seem to be much new growth from the base. The remaining branches have spread out in an unattractive shape. Is there anything I can do to re-create an attractive shape by trimming or pruning this overgrown bush?

shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and yew, are commonly grown as formal hedges but cannot be renovated in this way. do not prune these shrubs back into dead portions of the branches, as this will create large open gaps in the hedge, and these species do not readily fill in those gaps with new growth. if these hedge species become too large or unattractive, they will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. pruning overgrown evergreen shrubs large, overgrown evergreen shrubs with scale and needle - like foliage, such as juniper and pine, and some with broad leaves, like boxwood, are a more complex problem. large evergreen shrubs possess bare or dead zones in their centers. they cannot be pruned back severely because they are incapable of initiating new growth from bare branches. this means that these shrubs can only be reduced in size to a certain extent, as they should only be pruned back to green areas. do not prune evergreen shrubs back into dead portions of the branches. any large hole or gap in the canopy revealed by pruning will always remain. large, overgrown junipers, spruces, pines, or other conifers that have become too large or unattractive will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. some species, such as yew and, to a lesser extent, boxwood and arborvitae, can initiate some new growth from bare stems and may eventually fill in, but this process can take a considerable amount of time. this means these evergreen shrubs, when severely pruned, may be unattractive for five or more years, and some may never fully fill in. often, it is best to remove and replace even these shrubs to maintain an attractive planting.

Oak leaf gall mites are more of a problem for humans than for oak trees. These insects live inside the galls on oak leaves. If they leave the galls in search of other food, they can be a true nuisance. Their bites are itchy and painful. So exactly what are oak leaf mites? What is effective in treating oak mites? If you want more information on how to get rid of oak mites, also called oak leaf itch mites, read on.
What are Oak Leaf Mites?
Oak tree gall mites are tiny parasites that attack gall larvae on oak leaves. When we say tiny, we mean tiny! You may not be able to spot one of these mites without a magnifying glass. The female and male oak tree gall mites mate. Once the females are fertilized, they enter the gall and paralyze the larvae with their venom. The female mites then feed on the larvae until their offspring emerge. An entire generation of oak mites can emerge in a single week, which means that the mite population can swell rapidly. Once the oak tree gall mites have eaten the gall larvae, they leave in search of other food. Even if they don’t run out of food, mites may leave the galls. They may fall from the tree or be blown off by a breeze. This usually happens late in the season when the mite population is very large. Some 300,000 mites can fall from each tree every day.
Oak tree gall mites can enter a house through open windows or screens and bite people inside. More often, however, the mites bite people while working outdoors in the garden. The bites usually occur on the upper body or wherever clothing is loose. They are painful and itch a lot. People who are not aware of oak tree gall mites think they have been bitten by bed bugs. You might think that spraying the oak tree would be an effective oak mite control, but this is not the case. The oak tree gall mites actually live inside the galls. Since tree sprays do not penetrate the galls, the mites are safe from sprays. If you are wondering how to get rid of oak mites, there is no perfect solution. You can try to exercise oak mite control by using DEET, a commercially available mosquito and tick repellent. In the end though, you can only protect yourself best by being vigilant. Stay away from oak trees with galls toward the end of summer. When you do go into the garden or near the trees, shower and wash your clothes in hot water when you come in from gardening.

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2
what's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such"

Title: Potato (Solanum tuberosum)-Ring Rot | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks
By P. B. Hamm and C. M. Ocamb
Cause A bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (formerly Corynebacterium sepedonicum), which overwinters in infected tubers or as a dried slime on machinery and sacks, in storage houses, etc. It does not overwinter in soil except in infected volunteer plants. Knives used during seed-cutting operations can easily spread ring rot bacteria from infected tubers to healthy tubers.
Symptom expression varies by variety. Foliage generally does not show symptoms until mid to late in the growing season. The first symptom is a shortened internode length in the terminals. These bunchy or rosetted terminals are a darker green than the rest of the plant. A pronounced yellowing occurs between leaflet veins, and the leaflet margin rolls up and becomes necrotic.
A “green wilt” also may occur with or without the above symptoms. One or more stems in a hill may show symptoms while the rest appear normal. When affected stems are cut at the ground line and squeezed, a creamy white mass of bacteria may ooze from the water-conducting tissue.
Ring rot in tubers may not develop until they have been in storage several months, or it may be present at digging or before. When infected tubers are cut near the stem end, ring rot symptoms may appear as yellow or light brown rings of cheesy consistency in the tuber's vascular ring. In advanced tuber rot, dry gray pockets of decayed tissue surround the vascular ring. Secondary rots may completely destroy the tuber, either in the soil or in storage.
Note: Plants and tubers, especially of 'Shepody', may be infected with ring rot bacteria without showing symptoms.
- Use only certified seed potatoes.
- Plant whole, single-drop seed. Avoid using picker planters because the pick spreads disease.
- Disinfect cutting knives at least three (3) times a day when cutting a single lot of potato seed. Always disinfect before cutting a new seed lot.
- Disinfect storage bins, tools, trucks, and other equipment frequently during cutting and planting operations. Always clean extensively before beginning seed handling operations at the start of the season.
Chemical control Disinfectants or fumigants with the following active ingredients are effective against bacterial ring rot. Check with your state Department of Agriculture to determine which formulations are acceptable for the area being cleaned. In general, disinfect by wetting the surface with the product for at least 10 min. Formaldehyde-based products are ineffective.
- Copper 8-Quinolinolate (PQ 80). Use a 10 % solution in a 1:200 dilution.
- Quaternary ammonium compounds at 5 oz of a 10% solution/10 gal water.
- Sodium hypochlorite in a 1,000 to 2,000 ppm chlorine solution. Ultra Clorox bleach can be used on seed potatoes and storages in Oregon, can only be used on seed potatoes as they are going through the cutting process in Washington. Check with your state Department of Agriculture to determine which formulations are acceptable for the item being cleaned.

User > I am looking for a good plant for part shade that deer don't eat. I have an area beside my patio that has a lot of Hakonechloa macra Japanese Forest Grass in it and it's dying. I think that's because it's too hot there and the moisture is variable. It certainly is not in a shady forest. I am going to pull it out. But what should I put in its place? We have a huge herd of white tail deer living with us and it has to be something they don't like. I have a Goshiki Osmanthus there that seems happy. Otherwise, the space will be empty. I would like something fairly low growing because there's a picture window right there and I like to look out from there at my garden. Do you have any suggestions?

Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
17 deer - resistant shade plants that will brighten up your garden these pretty perennials and shrubs will grow in shady spots and deer tend to leave them alone. by nicole bradley nicole bradley nicole bradley kinning is a former garden and home improvement writer for better homes & gardens, where she has also written about pets, beauty and lifestyle topics. learn about bhg's editorial process updated on february 5, 2026 reviewed by joseph tychonievich reviewed by joseph tychonievich joseph tychonievich is a gardening expert with two decades of work in horticulture, the author of three gardening books, and known for his deep knowledge of the science behind techniques for successful gardening. learn about bhg's gardening review board close credit : david mcdonald deer - resistant shade plants are a smart choice for gardens with low light and plenty of browsing deer. gardening where deer are plentiful can be challenging, especially in shady conditions. focus on plants with substantially textured leaves that may lack appeal to hungry critters, or flavors they find bitter and unappetizing. deer are also turned off by heavily scented herbs, so intermingling those with your flowering plants or choosing plants with pungent aromas will help keep them away, although no plant can be considered completely deer - resistant. 01 of 17 lily - of - the - valley bush credit : marilyn ott deer often browse many landscape plants, but lily - of - the - valley bush ( pieris spp. ) is typically left alone. this broadleaf evergreen for part shade has thick, glossy green leaves and drooping clusters of spring flowers in pink, white, or rose. you may also see it sold as andromeda. plant it where you can enjoy the blooms up close — such as in a foundation planting or in a shrub border. give it acidic soil and steady moisture ; dry soil can lead to stress and poor flowering. the flowers, leaves, and sap of the lily - of - the - valley shrub are considered highly toxic to humans and pets. so, use caution when planting this pretty shrub where children and pets play. growing conditions : slightly moist, acidic soil size : to 12 feet tall and 8 feet wide zones : 5 - 8 02 of 17 lungwort credit : david mcdonald lungwort ( pulmonaria ) is a dependable shade perennial that deer usually skip. it ’ s grown as much for its spotted or silvery leaves as for its spring flowers, which often open pink and shift to blue as they age. tuck lungwort around spring bulbs for a layered look — narcissus and scilla are especially easy partners because they bloom around the same time. growing conditions : slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 1 foot tall and 2 feet wide zones : 2 - 8 03 of 17 astilbe credit : mike jensen bring color to shady spots with the feathery flower plumes of astilbe. depending on the variety, astilbe blooms in shades of red, coral, white, lavender, or cream. its fern - like leaves also adds texture before and after flowering. for best results, keep the soil consistently moist — astilbe can struggle in dry shade. growing conditions : rich, moist, well - drained soil size : to 3 feet tall and 30 inches wide zones : 4 - 8 20 shady garden corner ideas for a vibrant shade garden 04 of 17 jack - in - the - pulpit credit : marty baldwin bursting into bloom in the early spring, jack - in - the - pulpit ( arisaema triphyllum ) is a native woodland plant that blooms in spring and handles shade well. the “ flower ” is a hooded structure ( often green or purple ) that stands out in a shade garden. red berries may follow later in the season, and the plant typically goes dormant by midsummer — so don ’ t be surprised if it disappears until next year. deer tend to avoid jack - in - the - pulpit because it contains calcium oxalate, which can irritate when eaten. jack - in - the - pulpits are toxic, especially the corms ( bulblike roots ), so exercise caution when planting these if you have pets or small children around. growing conditions : rich, damp, acidic soil size : to 2 feet tall and 18 inches wide zones : 4 - 9 05 of 17 columbine credit : andrew drake columbine ( aquilegia spp. ), adds delicate color to part shade with nodding, lanternlike blooms held on slender stems. many gardeners also find it to be a deer - resistant choice, especially once established. columbine comes in many colors and flower shapes. it can be short - lived, but it often reseeds — so you may see new seedlings pop up nearby each spring. if you want it to spread, let a few plants go to seed ; if you prefer a tidier look, remove spent flowers before they form seedpods. growing conditions : moist, well - drained soil size : to 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 this partial shade garden plan creates a colorful spot to relax 06 of 17 bergenia credit : peter krumhardt with clusters of pink spring flowers and glossy, heart - shaped leaves, bergenia is a sturdy choice for shade and part shade. it ’ s sometimes called pigsqueak because the thick leaves can squeak when rubbed. in milder climates, bergenia may stay green through winter, adding year - round texture near paths, under trees, or at the front of a border. growing conditions : rich, moist, well - drained soil size : to 18 inches tall and wide zones : 3 - 8 07 of 17 japanese painted fern credit : janet mesic mackie if deer browse your shade garden, consider japanese painted fern ( athyrium niponicum pictum ). this fern grows 12 – 18 inches tall and stands out for its silvery fronds with green and maroon tones. given time, it forms tidy clumps that slowly expand. plant it where you ’ ll notice the leaf color — along a walkway, in a woodland - style planting, or near water where the soil stays evenly moist. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 9 japanese painted fern thrives when planted in woodland gardens, near ponds and streams, along walkways, and in shaded patio gardens. 08 of 17 ligularia credit : peter krumhardt bold leaves and bright yellow flower spikes make ligularia a standout in shade. deer often pass it by, but this plant is picky about moisture. if the soil dries out — especially in summer heat — ligularia can wilt and look ragged. help it thrive by keeping the soil consistently moist and using mulch to slow evaporation. ligularia is a natural fit near water, such as along a shady stream bank, in a rain garden, or at the edge of a pond. growing conditions : grow in moisture - retentive soil and water deeply once a week size : to 4 feet tall and wide zones : 4 - 9 09 of 17 brunnera credit : john reed forsman also called siberian bugloss, brunnera ( brunnera macrophylla ) earns its keep in shade with heart - shaped leaves and sky - blue spring flowers. deer usually leave it alone. over time, brunnera forms fuller clumps and may also reseed, especially in moist, rich soil. if volunteer seedlings show up where you don ’ t want them, pull them while they ’ re small. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 30 inches wide zones : 3 - 8 show your love with these 6 heart - shape houseplants 10 of 17 oregon grape holly credit : denny schrock oregon grape holly ( mahonia aquifolium ) is a shade - loving shrub with thick, leathery leaves that have spiny edges — one reason deer tend to avoid it. in spring, it produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by blue - black berries later in the season. give this shrub room to spread slowly by runners if you ’ d like it to form a low, evergreen colony. growing conditions : slightly acidic, well - drained, moist soil size : to 3 feet tall and 5 feet wide zones : 5 - 8 if you want berries, you need to plant two or more shrubs. 11 of 17 skimmia credit : denny schrock skimmia ( skimmia spp. ) is a broadleaf evergreen that handles shade and brings spring fragrance, thanks to clusters of white flowers. on female plants, those blooms can be followed by showy red berries in fall. skimmia is also a deer - resistant shrub that works well in a foundation planting or as a low flowering hedge. for berries, plan on planting both male and female plants. the berries also attract songbirds. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 4 feet tall and wide zones : 6 - 8 12 of 17 burkwood daphne credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly over time, forming a wider patch of foliage and blooms. plant it where it has room to expand, and keep the soil slightly moist but never soggy. growing conditions : well - drained, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 frequently asked questions what are products that keep deer away from plants? some gardeners try scent - based deterrents such as blood meal or garlic placed around the garden. results vary, and you may need to reapply after rain. is there a natural deer repellant that works? some gardeners use strong - smelling, egg - based sprays as a \\\" natural \\\" repellent. if you try this approach, follow a tested recipe, reapply as needed ( especially after rain ), and avoid spraying edible parts of food crops unless the directions specifically say it ’ s safe. do motion - activated sprinklers keep deer way from plants? motion - activated sprinklers can help scare deer away, especially when you place them near the edges of the garden where deer enter. set the sensor to cover the approach path and adjust it as plants grow. explore more : gardening pest & problem fixes garden pests was this page helpful? thanks for your feedback! tell us why! other submit sources better homes & gardens is committed to using high -

User > Why are my raspberry bushes turning yellow and how can I help them? I planted 4 raspberry bushes in my yard in early June and have noticed a couple are starting to get yellow leaves near the ground. The property has clay soil and gets pretty wet from all the rain so I put sand/compost mix around the area these bushes were planted and topped it off with some pine bark and western red cedar mulch. I am looking for information on what I can do to ensure their health and make sure they last!

User > I need expert advice regarding a drainage problem with the raised beds in a semi-commercial greenhouse that I was recently hired to manage. The bottom two thirds of the bed are rock, followed by a heavy plastic barrier with 8 inches of soil on top. Water cannot drain past the plastic. I am concerned that removing the plastic will create a false water table in the rocks below. I'm also concerned that leaving it in place is preventing proper drainage. A related situation: root aeration. When the greenhouse was constructed, ventilation was installed in the rock layer for the purpose of aerating roots. Note the PVC pipe in attached pictures. The pipe runs the length of the bed, up the side of the greenhouse and vents near the ceiling. The plastic layer is functioning as a vapor barrier, so the design fails on this point. I am out of my depth with this situation and appreciate any help you can provide regarding the greenhouse raised bed drainage. I am open to the possibility of an in-person evaluation, if you feel more data is needed before providing a recommended course of action.

get the competitive edge. ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. the top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions. as a general rule, warm - season grasses only need to be watered once or twice a week. cool - season grasses require more frequent watering, up to three times a week in hot weather. turfgrass species growing in shade require less water than the same species growing in full sun. turfgrass growing on clay soils does not need to be watered as frequently as turfgrass growing on sandy soils, because clay soils retain water longer than sandy soils, and sandy soils drain water and dry out quickly. low application rates and / or division of total irrigation time into 2 or more applications per day are sometimes needed on clay soils to allow water infiltration and prevent puddling and runoff. for specific irrigation requirements for warm - and cool - season turfgrasses in various regions of california and at different sprinkler outputs, see the uc guide to healthy lawns and the lawn watering guide for california. additional resources are managing lawns in shade, managing lawns on heavy soils, and managing turfgrasses during drought. each turfgrass species has specific mowing - height requirements ( see mowing your lawn and grasscycling ). mowing some grasses too short can weaken the turfgrass and increase weed invasions. alternatively, if some grasses are not mowed short enough, the thatch layer can build up, reducing water penetration and weakening the turfgrass. mow grasses more frequently when they are actively growing. a standard guide is to remove no more than 1 / 3 of the leaf blade at each mowing. if too much is removed at one time, it can take some time for the grass to recover, giving weeds a chance to invade. lawns with weed invasions often appear uneven. mow weedy lawns frequently enough to avoid this patchy appearance and prevent flower and weed seed formation. be sure that mower blades are sharp enough so that the turfgrass is not damaged. for large areas, it is best to mow the least weedy section first and the weediest section last to avoid spreading weeds. washing the mower's deck and underside afterwards will remove weed seeds. the same applies if mowers are moved from weedy lawns to other lawns, to avoid transporting weed seeds and propagules. avoid mowing lawns when the soil is wet, such as after rain or irrigation ; moving a mower over wet soil can lead to compaction. to maintain a healthy lawn, follow fertilizing guidelines carefully. begin a regular fertilization program approximately 6 weeks after planting. in general, lawns need to be fertilized about four times a year while they are actively growing, with no more than 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application. see practical lawn fertilization for requirements for specific turfgrass species. regular thatch removal will help keep your turfgrass healthy and competitive with weeds. thatch is a layer of organic matter ( stems, stolons, roots ) that develops between the turfgrass blades and the soil surface. a thin layer of thatch is normal and even beneficial ; it can help limit weed germination. some turfgrass species, particularly warm - season creeping grasses, develop thick thatch layers that can prevent the circulation of air, water, and nutrients in the soil. generally, you should dethatch your lawn when the thatch layer is more than 1 / 2 inch thick. for some species, such as zoysiagrass, bermudagrass, or kentucky bluegrass, this may mean dethatching every year. for other species, such as tall fescue, dethatching may only be needed every 5 years or not at all. use a thatching rake on small lawns to loosen the layer of thatch. on creeping - type grass lawns, such as bermudagrass, use a verticutter or dethatcher to cut through the lawn to the soil surface. heavy traffic can compact soil over time. soil compaction restricts the flow of oxygen, water, and nutrients into the roots, causing the turfgrass to grow slowly and making it more susceptible to weed invasions. alleviate soil compaction with regular aeration. lawns on heavy clay soils or lawns with heavy foot or equipment traffic may need to be aerated several times a year while lawns with little activity may only need to be aerated once a year or less. aerators, sometimes called aerifiers, remove small cores of soil or create pores or channels in the rooting zone. a hand - held aerifier may be adequate on small lawns. for larger areas, machine - driven aerifiers are more practical and can be found at equipment rental businesses. aerate when the turfgrass is actively growing. be aware that aeration will leave temporary holes in the turf that will gradually fill in within a few weeks ; however some weed seeds may germinate in the spaces during that time. soil cores are usually left on the lawn surface and quickly break down with irrigation ; however some soil cores may contain weed seeds. in lawns that are known to be weedy, a preemergence herbicide application should be considered following aeration. controlling occasional weeds by hand pulling may be all that is necessary if you practice regular and proper maintenance procedures. hand weeding is particularly important for preventing infestations of creeping woodsorrel ( oxalis ), nutsedge, dandelion, spurge, dallisgrass, and bermudagrass. remove weeds while they are still young and before they set seed or produce rhizomes or tubers. remove small patches before they get large. making this a regular habit will greatly reduce the number of weeds in your lawn. be sure to remove the entire weed, including the root. a dandelion fork or fishtail weeder is useful for removing weeds with a thick taproot. larger patches can be dug out and the holes filled with clean soil. if your lawn is properly maintained, herbicides will generally not be necessary. when they are needed, use them as part of an integrated management program that includes good cultural maintenance practices. no single

free of weeds. this is important when planting with seed or sod. perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. for perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules ( stems, rhizomes, and tubers ). it is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules will desiccate on the soil surface. rake off and remove the propagules. if you have particularly troublesome weed problems, continue to work the soil without irrigating for several months to bring up new propagules. a few species such as field bindweed and purple nutsedge cannot be controlled in this manner. a nonselective, systemic herbicide such as glyphosate, applied when weeds are actively growing, can also be used to kill many difficult - to - control perennials, but repeat applications may be needed. soil solarization can be very effective at controlling many weed species prior to planting and is ideal for gardeners who want to avoid herbicide use. once the area is rototilled, amended, and prepared for planting, place clear polyethylene plastic 1 to 2 mils ( 0. 025 - 0. 050 mm ) thick over the moist soil surface, and cover the edges with soil to hold them in place. for best results, soil solarization must be carried out during the time of highest solar radiation — from june to august in inland california — and the tarps must remain on the infested soil for 4 to 6 weeks. solarization is less effective or ineffective in cooler coastal areas or in the shade. many annual weeds can be controlled with this method ; however, soil solarization is not as effective at controlling certain perennials such as field bindweed and nutsedge. refer to pest notes : soil solarization for more information. many soils need to be amended with organic matter or nutrients. amendments can improve drainage in clay soils or improve the water - holding capacity in sandy soils. the ability of soils to drain water and simultaneously hold enough water is extremely important in establishing the turfgrass root system and maintaining healthy lawns. lawns thrive in soils with good drainage that allow the unrestricted flow of oxygen, nutrients, and water. when adding topsoil, make sure it is from a reputable source and that it is free of rocks, weed propagules such as rhizomes or tubers, and herbicide residues. select an appropriate turfgrass species turfgrass species vary in their tolerance to extreme temperatures, shade, drought, and amount of wear. they are divided into two broad categories : cool - season and warm - season grasses, which reflect their temperature preference and periods of active growth. cool - season species such as tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and kentucky bluegrass thrive at 60 - 80°f and may become stressed or go into a semi - dormant state in periods of extreme cold or hot temperatures. they do best in northern and coastal california climates, although there are cool - season grasses grown throughout california. warm - season grasses such as bermudagrass, buffalograss, kikuyugrass, st. augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass grow best in southern california or central valley climates where summers are hot and dry and winters are relatively mild. these grasses go dormant during winter months when soil temperatures drop below 52°f and then green up in spring when soil temperatures rise. in general, cool - season grasses are less drought - tolerant and require 25 % more water than warm - season grasses grown in the same location. when planting a lawn, choose a species that best fits your specific conditions. poorly adapted species are more susceptible to weed invasions and require more intense maintenance than well - adapted species. for more information refer to the publication turfgrass selection for the home landscape, listed in references. it is essential to choose a planting time that allows the turfgrass species to establish quickly and be competitive with weeds. warm - season grasses should be planted from mid - spring to midsummer. cool - season grasses should be planted in early spring or fall. lawns will compete with weeds more effectively if established quickly. lawns established from sod have few weed problems from the moment they are planted. lawns planted from seed, stolons, or plugs can take up to 2 months to become established and are, therefore, more susceptible to weed invasions. weed management in newly planted lawns even if a planting site has been carefully prepared, some weeds will probably develop in a new lawn. remove weeds by hand as they appear. this will prevent them from producing seed and extending the invasion. properly timed irrigation, mowing, and fertilization can keep weeds under control. in the first few weeks after planting turfgrass roots are fairly short, extending only into the top few inches of soil. water lightly to keep the root zone moist without saturating the soil. once the turfgrass becomes established, encourage healthy root growth to deeper depths with deep, infrequent watering. mow new lawns for the first time when their roots are firmly planted in the soil. be sure the soil is fairly dry so that the young turfgrass is not torn from the ground. weed management in established lawns many lawns are watered incorrectly. poor irrigation practices can weaken turfgrass, allowing weeds to invade. annual bluegrass, crabgrass, dallisgrass, and nutsedge are just a few weed species that thrive in poorly irrigated lawns. to maintain a healthy lawn, uniform water coverage is needed. sprinkler heads that are broken, obstructed, or set too low or too high may not reach all areas of the lawn and can result in dry or dead spots in an otherwise healthy turfgrass. in general, deep, infrequent irrigation will encourage healthy root growth. light, frequent watering is only required when the turfgrass has just been planted and the root system is developing. watering established turfgrass lightly and frequently creates a shallow - rooted lawn, making it less durable and allowing shallow - rooted weeds such as crabgrass to get the competitive edge. ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. the top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions.

weeds can occur in all lawns but rarely become problems in well - managed, healthy turfgrass. poor maintenance practices — such as improper fertilization, watering, and mowing — can weaken turfgrass and make it susceptible to weed invasion. total eradication of weeds isn ’ t realistic or necessary for most lawns. with good management practices, a lawn can be vigorous and attractive with little or no herbicide use. why is weed identification important? - different weeds may require different management approaches. - many weed species are associated with lawn conditions, such as overwatering, compacted soil, or low fertility. identifying the weed species can give an indication of the underlying lawn care problem, which can be corrected. - for help identifying weeds, visit ipm. ucanr. edu. prevent weed invasions with proper lawn care. - choose a turfgrass species well adapted for your area or needs. - uniform water coverage is essential ; regularly check sprinkler heads and adjust if needed. - water deeply and infrequently. - when mowing, remove no more than one - third of the leaf blade. mowing height can vary depending on turfgrass species. - fertilize with 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application up to 4 times a year. - heavy traffic can compact soil ; aerate the soil when grass is actively growing. - remove thatch if it is more than half an inch thick. - identify the weed species. - determine if there is an underlying lawn care problem such as improper fertilizing, watering, and mowing, and correct it. - remove weeds by hand when they are young and before they flower, set seed, form vegetative parts, or spread into patches. - overseed, patch, or renovate problem areas within the lawn. - before using an herbicide, address the underlying reason why weeds are invading. what about pesticides? - choose a selective herbicide that is labeled for use against your problem weed and can be used without damaging your turfgrass species. - nonselective herbicides can harm desirable turfgrass and other plants. - contact herbicides damage plant tissue but don't kill plant roots. these herbicides are most successful when applied to young weeds. - for more information on herbicides available for use on lawns, see the uc ipm pest notes : weed management in lawns. download a pdf of this quick tips. descargue un pdf de estos notas breves. pest notes : introduction weeds occur in every lawn, but they seldom become problems in well - managed, vigorously growing turfgrass. proper site preparation and turfgrass selection before planting are essential to give a new lawn a healthy start. once a lawn is established, poor maintenance practices that weaken it — such as improper irrigation, fertilization, or mowing — are the primary factors likely to predispose it to weed invasion. activities that lead to compaction also contribute significantly to turfgrass stress, making it easier for weeds to invade. an integrated weed management program can reduce most weed populations to tolerable levels and prevent large, unsightly weed patches. total eradication of weeds is not a realistic or necessary goal for most lawns and park turfgrass ; however, with proper maintenance a lawn can be practically free of weeds without the extensive use of chemicals. refer to the uc guide to healthy lawns ( see references ) for

Title: Pests of Tomato | NC State Extension Publications

tomatoes are attacked by a large number of insect pests from the time plants first emerge in the seedbed until harvest. aphids, flea beetles, and leafminers threaten young transplant - bed tomatoes. in the field, flea beetles, aphids, leafminers, stink bugs, and tomato fruitworms cause minimal damage to the foliage ; however, severe damage may result either from their feeding on the fruit or by their spreading of diseases. greenhouse tomatoes have many of the same pests as field tomatoes. tiny pests such as aphids, whiteflies, leafminers, and twospotted spider mites, however, are more likely to infest greenhouse crops than beetles, grubs, or caterpillars. occasionally, moths enter through holes in screens or fans and lay eggs in greenhouses. even in screened greenhouses, tomato fruitworms and cabbage loopers may be brought into the greenhouses on plants. a. pests that feed on the upper plant - pests that mine leaves or bore into fruits or buds - tomato fruitworm ( also known as corn earworm ) — early instars are cream colored or yellowish green with few markings. later instars are green, reddish, or brown, with pale stripes and scattered black spots, moderately hairy, and up to 1 3 / 4 inches long, with three pairs of legs and five pairs of prolegs ( figure 1 ). these larvae chew holes in fruits and buds. - tobacco budworm — this caterpillar looks similar to the tomato fruitworm, except mature worms are somewhat smaller and slightly more slender than tomato fruitworms ( figure 2 ) ; in addition, the microscopic spines on the skin of tobacco budworms are more slender, longer, and occur closer to the setae ( hairs ). - tomato pinworm — tiny, yellowish - gray larvae make blotch mines in leaves. older yellow, green, or gray purple - spotted larvae grow up to 5 / 16 inch long ( figure 3 ) ; they fold leaves and web them together or bore into stems, buds, and fruit. fruits will have pinholes and discolored blotches. - vegetable leafminer — the larva is a colorless to bright - yellow maggot, up to 1 / 8 inch long, with a tapered head ( figure 4 ). larvae make serpentine mines in leaves, with each mine slightly enlarged at one end. - pests that chew holes in leaves - blister beetles — several species of slender, elongate beetles with prominent heads grow up to 3 / 4 inch long. bodies are variously colored but usually black ( figure 5a ), black with yellow margins ( figure 5b ), or black - and - yellow striped ( figure 5c ). they leave stringy, black excrement on heavily infested plants. foliage is raggedly chewed, and plants are sometimes stunted. ( for more information about blister beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - cabbage looper — this green caterpillar has longitudinal white stripes. its body is up to 1 3 / 16 inches long, tapering toward the head ( figure 6 ). it has three pairs of legs near the head and three pairs of fleshy prolegs. young larvae hang out on the undersides of leaves, consuming tender leaf tissue while leaving most veins intact. ( for more information about cabbage loopers, see “ pests of crucifers. ” ) - colorado potato beetle — these yellowish - brown, oval, convex beetles ( figure 7 ) are up to 9 / 16 inch long with five black longitudinal stripes on each wing cover and several black spots on the pronotum ( area behind the head ). they feed on leaves and terminal growth. ( for more information about colorado potato beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - flea beetles — these various species of tiny, dark - colored beetles, 1 / 8 to 3 / 16 inch long, have solid - brown to black bodies ( figure 8a ), brown bodies with dark spots ( figure 8b ), or black bodies with a pale - yellow stripe on each wing cover ( figure 8c ). their feeding leaves tiny, round holes in foliage. ( for more information about flea beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - hornworms — these green to reddish - brown caterpillars are up to 3 1 / 2 inches long with a red or black anal horn. the body has seven diagonal marks ( tobacco hornworm, figure 9b ) or eight v - shaped marks on each side ( tomato hornworm, figure 9a ) and round, black spiracles along the side of the body. hornworms strip leaves from vines and infrequently feed on fruit, leaving large, open, superficial scars. - sap - sucking pests that cause leaf discoloration, leaf or fruit deformation, or defoliation - aphids — soft - bodied, pear - shaped insects with a pair of dark cornicles and a cauda protruding from the abdomen, aphids may be winged or wingless ( most common ). they feed in colonies, causing discoloration or mottling of the foliage and excreting honeydew on which sooty mold grows. - green peach aphid — the pale - yellow to green wingless adult is almost 1 / 8 inch long ( figure 10a ). the winged adult has a dark, dorsal blotch on a yellowish - green body ( figure 10b ). the nymph has three dark lines on its abdomen ( figure 10c ). ( for more information about green peach aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - potato aphid — adults and nymphs are solid pink, mottled green - and - pink, or light green with a dark stripe. adults are a little more than 1 / 8 inch long with long, slender cornicles about twice as long as the cauda ( figure 11 ). ( for more information about potato aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - greenhouse whitefly — this white, mothlike insect is about 1 / 16 inch long. it is found in conjunction with tiny, yellow crawlers ( first instars, the only immature stage that is mobile ) ; green, oval, flattened, immobile nymphs ; or pupae ( figure 12a – f ). their feeding activity causes leaves to yellow and drop from the plant. some plants may appear stunted and cease blooming, with black, sooty mold often present on leaves. - stink bug — a green or brown shield - shaped insect, the adult is up to 3 / 4 inch long ( figure 13 ). the nymph is green with orange and black markings. stink bugs pierce buds and fruit, causing buds to drop and fruit to be deformed. ( for more information about stink bugs, see “ pests of okra. ” ) - silverleaf whitefly — the adult is slightly smaller than the greenhouse whitefly ( females are almost 1 / 16 inch long, with males smaller ) and slightly more yellow in color. it holds its wings rooflike at about a 45 - degree angle. nymphs appear glassy to opaque yellowish and have a flattened, scalelike body with the margin near the leaf surface ( figure 14a – d ). the pupa is slightly rounded, its margins slope inward, and it lacks noticeable setae. infested plants are stunted and nonreproductive with black, sooty mold present. - twospotted spider mite — tiny ( almost microscopic ) and pale to dark green, twospotted spider mites have two or four dark - colored spots. adults and nymphs have eight legs ( figure 15 ). larvae have six legs. females are oval and about 1 / 64 inch long. males are tapered toward the rear. infested foliage becomes silvery because of pale - yellow stipples. leaves eventually become pale and die. mites spin silken webs on the undersides of leaves as they feed. ( for more information about twospotted spider mites, see “ pests of beans and peas. ” ) - western flower thrips — the adult, almost 1 / 16 inch long, varies from pale yellow to dark brown and has a rounded, narrow abdomen ( figure 16 ). larvae are distinctly yellow. infested plants are distorted and have a silvery appearance. western flower thrips are an important vector of tomato spotted wilt virus. - aphids — soft - bodied, pear - shaped insects with a pair of dark cornicles and a cauda protruding from the abdomen, aphids may be winged or wingless ( most common ). they feed in colonies, causing discoloration or mottling of the foliage and excreting honeydew on which sooty mold grows. b. pests that feed on roots or lower stems - cutworm — this fat, basically gray, brown, or black caterpillar is 1 5 / 8 to 2 inches long when fully grown, with three pairs of legs near the head and five pairs of fleshy prolegs ( figure 17 ). they are active at night. the young caterpillar climbs on leaves, and the older caterpillar severs seedling stems near the ground. they hide during the day in soil burrows at the bases of"

User: Is this an African killer bee in St Paul? Can you identify this bee/hornet/wasp? Never seen anything like it before. It was large, fast, and aggressive. Not at all like our local wasps or hornets, neither in behavior nor appearance. This is the best still I was able to get from a six second video I took after observing this unfamiliar creature; I had to run from it as it quickly became aggressive after I got too close. It disappeared after using wasp spray foam.

Title: Africanized bee - Wikipedia
spreads through florida, a densely populated state, officials worry that public fear may force misguided efforts to combat them : news reports of mass stinging attacks will promote concern and in some cases panic and anxiety, and cause citizens to demand responsible agencies and organizations to take action to help ensure their safety. we anticipate increased pressure from the public to ban beekeeping in urban and suburban areas. this action would be counter - productive. beekeepers maintaining managed colonies of domestic european bees are our best defense against an area becoming saturated with ahb. these managed bees are filling an ecological niche that would soon be occupied by less desirable colonies if it were vacant. — florida african bee action plan [ 47 ] [ edit ]  killer bee  is a term frequently used in media such as movies that portray aggressive behavior or actively seeking to attack humans.  africanized honey bee  is considered a more descriptive term in part because their behavior is increased defensiveness compared to european honey bees that can exhibit similar defensive behaviors when disturbed. [ clarification needed ] [ 48 ] the sting of the africanized honey bee is no more potent than any other variety of honey bee, and although they are similar in appearance to european honey bees, they tend to be slightly smaller and darker in color. although africanized honey bees do not actively search for humans to attack, they are more dangerous because they are more easily provoked, quicker to attack in greater numbers, and then pursue the perceived threat farther, for as much as a quarter of a mile ( 400 metres ). [ 1 ] while studies have shown that africanized honey bees can infiltrate european honey bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen ( thus usurping the hive ), this is less common than other methods. wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth ( periods when plants are not flowering ), but this behavior should not be confused with the aforementioned activity. the most common way that a european honey bee hive will become africanized is through crossbreeding during a new queen's mating flight. studies have consistently shown that africanized drones are more numerous, stronger and faster than their european cousins and are therefore able to out - compete them during these mating flights. the result of mating between africanized drones and european queens is almost always africanized offspring. [ 49 ] impact on apiculture [ edit ] in areas of suitable temperate climate, the survival traits of africanized honey bee colonies help them outperform european honey bee colonies. they also return later and work under conditions that often keep european honey bees hive - bound. this is the reason why they have gained a reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their european counterparts. studies show that in areas of florida that contain africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. [ 50 ] it is also becoming apparent that africanized honey bees have another advantage over european honey bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues, including parasites such as varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood, and even the mysterious colony collapse disorder which was plaguing beekeepers in the early 2000s. despite all its negative factors, it is possible that the africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.

oval, flattened pupa is pale green ( healthy ) or black ( parasitized ), with long hairs on its back and a fringe of short hairs around its body margin ( figure 20f ). after the adult has emerged, a white, almost - transparent pupal skin is left behind. distribution — greenhouse whiteflies are worldwide pests of greenhouse - grown ornamentals and vegetables. first discovered in england in 1856, they were found in the northeastern united states in 1870. tropical central america or south america are suggested origins of the greenhouse whitefly. host plants — greenhouse whiteflies infest a wide variety of ornamental and vegetable crops, and they can survive outdoors during the growing season, particularly in sheltered locations. some of the more important hosts besides tomato include bean, cucumber, eggplant, grape, lettuce, melon, potato, squash, strawberry, and tobacco. even trees, such as avocado, may be infested. damage — nymphs and adults extract plant sap through their needlelike mouthparts, with the adults preferring to feed on tender new growth. as a result, leaves turn yellow and drop from infested plants. in addition to having an unthrifty appearance, plants may be stunted and cease flowering. sooty mold often grows on leaves covered with honeydew secreted by whiteflies and interferes further with the growth of plants. life history — greenhouse whiteflies reproduce relatively slowly ( one generation every 30 to 45 days ), but each female lays about 250 eggs and lives as long as two months. adults usually are found on the lower surface of new leaves ( figure 21 ). there, they insert their eggs, which hatch five to seven days later. new crawlers move about the plant for a day or two, often from leaf to leaf, before inserting their mouthparts to feed. once this occurs, they probably do not move again until mature. the crawlers molt into later nymphal instars and then into pupae. finally, a new generation of whitish - yellow adults emerges. they soon are covered with a fine, white, waxy powder. parasitic wasps, encarsia formosa, sometimes help keep greenhouse whitefly populations under control. at temperatures below 75°f, the reproduction of these wasps is inhibited. as a result, whitefly infestations are favored by lower greenhouse temperatures. control of whiteflies is difficult because the eggs and immature forms are resistant to many aerosol and insecticide sprays. it is necessary to regularly apply pesticides to control emerging adults until the last of an entire generation of immature whiteflies has emerged. for specific chemical control recommendations, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta ( linnaeus ), sphingidae, lepidoptera tomato hornworm, manduca quinquemaculata ( haworth ), sphingidae, lepidoptera adult — hornworm moths have a wingspan of 4 to 5 inches. tobacco hornworm moths are slate brown ; tomato hornworm moths are ash gray. tobacco hornworm moths have six orange spots on each side of the abdomen ( figure 22a ) ; tomato hornworm moths have five similar, but less distinct, spots on each side ( figure 22e ). the wavy lines on the hind wings of the tomato hornworm are more distinct and jagged than the lines on the hind wings of the tobacco hornworm moth. egg —"

Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly"

Title: How to Prune Japanese Maples - PlantingTree
\n\nsunny days, as it causes more shock damage to the tree. with respect to timing, one question we commonly get is whether or not you can prune in the spring and fall. the answer is yes you can, however, it ’ s a good practice to be cautious when pruning at these times. pruning too heavily in the spring can cause damage to new buds and stunt growth. whereas pruning too late in the season can stimulate new growth which can be quickly damaged by freezing late fall temperatures where to cut when pruning the purpose of pruning is to encourage your tree ’ s natural growth habit. that being said, there are 5 types of branches you may want to consider removing from your japanese maple. - broken, diseased, or dead branches. these need to go for obvious reasons. prune them when you see them, no matter the time of year. - branches growing inward or in the wrong direction. while strange - looking branches can add character to a tree, they can also cause a lot of problems, particularly if they are growing inward. - crossing branches can result in damage to both the bark and the branches. this can encourage disease and pests, which is something you don ’ t want. if you find that you have several branches crossing in one area, you may consider removing a branch or two. - narrow crotches. this is where two branches meet at an angle of less than 45 degrees. remove one of the branches to open up your tree and reduce the possibility of breakage. - crowded branches. removing crowded branches is most important when it involves the crown of the tree. when you remove crowded branches and foliage in this area, it will increase airflow and help your tree breathe better. you can thin these areas by removing one out of every four branches or so. pruning tips & tricks where you cut matters when removing an entire branch, prune at a 45 - degree angle back to the branch collar, but not into it. basically, there shouldn ’ t be much of the branch left but you should never cut flush to the connecting branch or trunk. be sure to use clean, professional pruners for the best results. - do not prune young trees unless absolutely necessary. allow your tree to fully develop and grow into itself for 10 to 15 years before you do any serious pruning. - younger trees often get long, thin, whip - like branches. you may be tempted to prune off these scrawny long branches. however, it ’ s better if you don ’ t. be patient. they will fill out and get lateral branches. if you prune them off you are more likely to get even more of this same branch type. - don ’ t buy a japanese maple that grows too tall for the spot you have chosen. pruning japanese maples to control height is a fight you won ’ t win. it will only encourage faster growth and thinner, weaker branches. - do not prune off more than of the foliage or the crown of your japanese maple. - never over - prune. while aesthetic pruning of japanese maples is certainly an acceptable practice, we advise that you prune when necessary. believe it or not, sometimes less really is more. now you know how to prune japanese maples. just remember to be patient, take your time, and a little pruning maintenance can go a long way. plantingtree has many japanese maple varieties to choose from. from the bloodgood japanese maple to the coral bark maple and the orangeola, shop our premium hand -

third of the plant. you can trim less than that ’ s all that is needed, but avoid doing more unless your plant has been neglected for years and needs a major refresh. make cuts at an angle of about 45 degrees and about 0. 25 inch ( 0. 5 cm ) above a leaf node. if your shrub is already mostly upright, make cuts above leaf nodes that face outwards. if the shrub has horizontal growth that you want to train upwards, cut above inward - facing leaf nodes. you can direct a new branch to grow to the left or right by cutting above a node on the left side of a branch or on the right side, respectively. avoid making too many inward - facing cuts. this directs growth toward the center of the plant, which can help you get an upright structure, but which can also cause too much dense growth in the center. this can reduce airflow and promote common hibiscus diseases. when choosing stems to trim, look for the longest ones. trim them at a node that is about one - third of the way down the stem. choose strategically to create a shape that will be even and neat. for example, if you have more growth on one side of the shrub, making it appear lopsided, make more cuts on that side. different ways to prune hibiscus depending on your plant's needs and your own desired look, there are a few different techniques for pruning hibiscus : - some light pruning will encourage more flowers to grow on your hibiscus. to do this, pinch off growing tips in the spring and even into summer. pinch off about 0. 25 to 1 inch ( 0. 5 to 2. 5 cm ) of growth. this is an especially useful type of pruning for young plants, as it will train them to grow fuller and in an even shape. - for a full prune, cut each stem back by about a third to two or three nodes. this will promote branching, blooming, and a pleasing shape. however, blooming will be delayed till the new growth forms. - for selective pruning, only remove one - third or less of the stems from the base. this will allow some stems to continue blooming, while the rest are developing. - if you have an old, neglected hibiscus shrub, you can cut more severely. trim all of the stems down to about 1 foot ( 30 cm ) off the ground to encourage new, healthier growth. be sure the remaining stems have some leaves on them. trimming hibiscus into a tree hibiscus is a shrub, but with the right pruning, you can prune your shrub into a small tree. look for one large, strong stem to use as the “ trunk ” of the tree. it should be at least 2 feet ( 0. 6 m ) tall. trim it off by about 2 inches ( 5 cm ) and then trim back all the lower branches. trim back all the upper stems on your primary trunk to create a ball shape on the top. this will be the top of your tree. make sure these stems still have two or three nodes after trimming and that they are about 6 inches ( 30 cm ) long. maintain the shape by trimming off lower branches as they form. pruning hibiscus is a necessary garden chore, but you don ’ t have to do it every year. prune lightly for more flowers and to remove any damaged or dead branches yearly, and do a more vigorous pruning every few years for the best results. frequently asked questions do you need to cut back hibiscus every year? if you have a containerized hibiscus that you overwinter indoors, it will benefit from annual pruning. if your hibiscus shrubs are outdoors year - round and they did not suffer any frost damage, you can decide if you want to skip pruning that year. can you prune hibiscus in summer? you can pinch off the tips in summer to encourage fullness and you can “ fix ” any protruding stems that look awkward by cutting them back. you also can lightly shape the plant if needed. shop pruning essentials make the perfect cut for quick & easy cleanup mary ellen ellis has been gardening for over 20 years. with degrees in chemistry and biology, mary ellen's specialties are flowers, native plants, and herbs. -

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly over time, forming a wider patch of foliage and blooms. plant it where it has room to expand, and keep the soil slightly moist but never soggy. growing conditions : well - drained, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 frequently asked questions what are products that keep deer away from plants? some gardeners try scent - based deterrents such as blood meal or garlic placed around the garden. results vary, and you may need to reapply after rain. is there a natural deer repellant that works? some gardeners use strong - smelling, egg - based sprays as a \\\" natural \\\" repellent. if you try this approach, follow a tested recipe, reapply as needed ( especially after rain ), and avoid spraying edible parts of food crops unless the directions specifically say it ’ s safe. do motion - activated sprinklers keep deer way from plants? motion - activated sprinklers can help scare deer away, especially when you place them near the edges of the garden where deer enter. set the sensor to cover the approach path and adjust it as plants grow. explore more : gardening pest & problem fixes garden pests was this page helpful? thanks for your feedback! tell us why! other submit sources better homes & gardens is committed to using high - quality, reputable sources — including peer - reviewed studies — to support the facts in our articles. read about our editorial policies and standards to learn more about how we fact check our content for accuracy. pieris japonica. north carolina extension gardener plant toolbox. andromeda japonica. aspca. jack - in - the - pulpit. aspca jack - in - the - pulpit poisoning. national library of medicine daphne x burkwoodii. north carolina state university extension gardner toolbox. aesculus parviflora. north carolina state extension.

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

User > A year ago we bought a strawberry hydrangea tree. We planted it in a pot because we didn't have time to plant it in the ground so it could overwinter. Now, the hydrangea tree has almost no leaves, only up to the tips of the branches. Can we still plant it in the ground so that it recovers its green leaves and possibly blooms?

what's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the

##er — this green caterpillar has longitudinal white stripes. its body is up to 1 3 / 16 inches long, tapering toward the head ( figure 6 ). it has three pairs of legs near the head and three pairs of fleshy prolegs. young larvae hang out on the undersides of leaves, consuming tender leaf tissue while leaving most veins intact. ( for more information about cabbage loopers, see “ pests of crucifers. ” ) - colorado potato beetle — these yellowish - brown, oval, convex beetles ( figure 7 ) are up to 9 / 16 inch long with five black longitudinal stripes on each wing cover and several black spots on the pronotum ( area behind the head ). they feed on leaves and terminal growth. ( for more information about colorado potato beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - flea beetles — these various species of tiny, dark - colored beetles, 1 / 8 to 3 / 16 inch long, have solid - brown to black bodies ( figure 8a ), brown bodies with dark spots ( figure 8b ), or black bodies with a pale - yellow stripe on each wing cover ( figure 8c ). their feeding leaves tiny, round holes in foliage. ( for more information about flea beetles, see “ pests of potato. ” ) - hornworms — these green to reddish - brown caterpillars are up to 3 1 / 2 inches long with a red or black anal horn. the body has seven diagonal marks ( tobacco hornworm, figure 9b ) or eight v - shaped marks on each side ( tomato hornworm, figure 9a ) and round, black spiracles along the side of the body. hornworms strip leaves from vines and infrequently feed on fruit, leaving large, open, superficial scars. - sap - sucking pests that cause leaf discoloration, leaf or fruit deformation, or defoliation - aphids — soft - bodied, pear - shaped insects with a pair of dark cornicles and a cauda protruding from the abdomen, aphids may be winged or wingless ( most common ). they feed in colonies, causing discoloration or mottling of the foliage and excreting honeydew on which sooty mold grows. - green peach aphid — the pale - yellow to green wingless adult is almost 1 / 8 inch long ( figure 10a ). the winged adult has a dark, dorsal blotch on a yellowish - green body ( figure 10b ). the nymph has three dark lines on its abdomen ( figure 10c ). ( for more information about green peach aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - potato aphid — adults and nymphs are solid pink, mottled green - and - pink, or light green with a dark stripe. adults are a little more than 1 / 8 inch long with long, slender cornicles about twice as long as the cauda ( figure 11 ). ( for more information about potato aphids, see “ pests of lettuce. ” ) - greenhouse whitefly — this white, mothlike insect is about 1 / 16 inch long. it is found in conjunction with tiny, yellow crawlers ( first instars, the only immature stage that is mobile ) ; green, oval, flattened, immobile nymphs ; or pupae ( figure

Title: Pests of Tomato | NC State Extension Publications
. damage to leaves and vines is of little importance, but injury to the fruit can cause a substantial loss. life history — in mexico, california, florida, and texas, tomato pinworms overwinter outdoors as pupae at or near the soil surface. in north carolina and most other states, pinworms spend winter in greenhouses. the nocturnal moths may emerge as early as march or april. eggs are usually deposited on the undersides of leaves and hatch about one week later. during summer, larvae mine the leaves for about six days and then fold leaves or bore into fruit for another six days. mature fourth - instar larvae either remain in folded leaves or drop to the soil to pupate. about 12 days later, a new generation of moths emerges. in summer, a generation can be completed every 26 to 34 days. in cooler weather, the life cycle is longer. seven to eight overlapping generations occur each year in florida. it is probable that just as many generations occur in north carolina greenhouses. if moths escape outdoors, several generations may occur in field tomatoes during summer. sanitation and prevention are good control measures for tomato pinworms. infestations usually result from transplants that are shipped in or grown in local greenhouses. therefore, close inspection of new plants can prevent serious problems later in the season. for recommended insecticides and rates, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. liriomyza sativae blanchard, agromyzidae, diptera adult — this shiny, black fly has variable yellow markings and is almost 1 / 16 inch long ( figure 28a ). egg — the extremely small, white, oval egg is sometimes visible through the upper epidermis of the leaf via a magnifying glass ( figure 28b ). larva — the newly hatched larva is nearly colorless and very small ( but visible with a magnifying glass ). the fully grown maggot, about 1 / 8 inch long, has a translucent, bright - yellow body and black mouthparts. each maggot has a slightly pointed head and a rounded abdomen ( figure 28c ). puparium — the flattened, segmented puparium is bright yellow at first but gradually turns brown. it is oblong - oval in shape and a little more than 1 / 16 inch long ( figure 28d ). distribution — the vegetable leafminer is found from the tropics into the southeastern and southwestern united states. it occurs at least as far north as tennessee and ohio. because this leafminer has long been confused with closely related species, the precise extent of its distribution is not known. host plants — closely related to the serpentine leafminer that feeds almost exclusively on crucifers, the vegetable leafminer infests a wide variety of plants. in addition to tomato, weed and cultivated crop hosts include squash, okra, pea, bean, cabbage, turnip, potato, tobacco, cotton, radish, spinach, watermelon, beet, pepper, alfalfa, clover, vetch, and plantain. damage — like serpentine leafminers, vegetable leafminers create light - colored, irregularly winding mines in leaves. the mines are generally s - shaped and may be enlarged at one end ( figure 28e ). infested leaves are favorable habitats for bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. also, because heavily mined leaves may have much of their mesophyll ( internal tissue ) removed, photosynthetic efficiency is greatly reduced ( figure 29 ). severe infestations may cause the foliage to turn brown and appear burned. damaging infestations are most likely to occur after crops have been treated weekly with insecticides such as methomyl or carbaryl. these pesticides kill parasitic wasps that usually keep the leafminer populations at acceptable levels. life history — vegetable leafminers feed and breed year - round in the southern areas of florida and texas. in north carolina, they overwinter in soil as pupae. generally, adult flies that emerge in april or may live only four to ten days. after mating, females insert eggs into leaf tissue from the underside of the leaf. eggs hatch three to eight days later, and young larvae begin feeding, each one creating its own mine. although the leaf - mining stage may last up to twelve days, it is usually completed in four to five days during summer. larvae pupate for about 10 days ( longer in spring and fall ) at the enlarged ends of the mines or in soil. a new generation is produced about every 23 days. at least five generations occur each year in southern states. the number is higher in the tropics and in greenhouses. on a small scale, it is practical to remove infested tomato leaves to help keep leafminer populations in check. economically significant leafminer damage rarely occurs on tomatoes. for large - scale producers, insecticides remain the most reliable method of controlling infestations. for recommended insecticides and rates, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. western flower thrips frankliniella occidentalis ( pergande ), thripidae, thysanoptera adult — the western flower thrips ( figure 30a ) is almost 1 / 16 inch long, with the female larger than the male. the female varies from yellow to dark - brown and has a plump abdomen. the male is always pale yellow and has a narrower abdomen. egg — yellowish eggs cannot be seen easily because they are inserted into the plant tissue ( figure 30b ). larva — the larvae develop through two instars and are distinctly yellow. first instars ( figure 30c ) are noticeably smaller than second instars. second instars ( figure 30d ) are about the same size as adult females, and they become whitish before molting. prepupa and pupa — both prepupa ( figure 30e ) and pupa ( figure 30f ) are quiescent, nonfeeding stages. they are yellowish. antennae of prepupae protrude forward, whereas antennae of pupae are folded back over the head. prepupae have noticeable wing pads on the thorax. wing pads of pupae extend back along the abdomen. distribution — before 1980, the distribution was thought to be limited to west of the mississippi river. however, the western flower thrips has become the most prevalent thrips species attacking greenhouse plants throughout the united states

shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and yew, are commonly grown as formal hedges but cannot be renovated in this way. do not prune these shrubs back into dead portions of the branches, as this will create large open gaps in the hedge, and these species do not readily fill in those gaps with new growth. if these hedge species become too large or unattractive, they will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. pruning overgrown evergreen shrubs large, overgrown evergreen shrubs with scale and needle - like foliage, such as juniper and pine, and some with broad leaves, like boxwood, are a more complex problem. large evergreen shrubs possess bare or dead zones in their centers. they cannot be pruned back severely because they are incapable of initiating new growth from bare branches. this means that these shrubs can only be reduced in size to a certain extent, as they should only be pruned back to green areas. do not prune evergreen shrubs back into dead portions of the branches. any large hole or gap in the canopy revealed by pruning will always remain. large, overgrown junipers, spruces, pines, or other conifers that have become too large or unattractive will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. some species, such as yew and, to a lesser extent, boxwood and arborvitae, can initiate some new growth from bare stems and may eventually fill in, but this process can take a considerable amount of time. this means these evergreen shrubs, when severely pruned, may be unattractive for five or more years, and some may never fully fill in. often, it is best to remove and replace even these shrubs to maintain an attractive planting.

They may not be alive, but I’m worried about planting new Coral bells and other plants in that same pot. Do you recommend getting rid of the old plants if there’s any suspicion of aphids? Or can I treat them with neem oil and all shall be well?

Title: Insects on Coral Bells - Ask Extension
Insects on Coral Bells #325283
Asked May 26, 2016, 12:34 AM EDT
Douglas County Oregon
Aphids feed on a wide variety of garden plants. Aphids are slow moving, soft bodied sucking insects that usually appear in clusters on new growth. More than 1,300 native species of aphids inhabit North America. They come in a wide range of colors from black to pink to white and pale green, and measure 1/16-1/4 inch long. Aphids are pear shaped and usually wingless, with two tubes, called cornicles, at the posterior end. Aphids cluster on leaves and stems, where they suck sap, causing curling and cupping of leaves. Severe infestations cause general loss of plant vigor and stunting, with reduced yields. Aphids excrete excess sugars and sap in a liquid called honeydew. This honeydew attracts ants and an air borne fungus called sooty mold. The ants feed on the honeydew. This food source is so valuable that some species of ants tend the aphids, and even take them into their shelters over winter. Such ants tend to aggravate the aphid problem, distributing them to new plants. Aphid populations can explode because of the insect’s ability to reproduce parthenogenetically (without fertilization). After one or two generations, winged aphids are born, and these fly off to other plants. When male and females mate towards the end of the season, eggs are produced, enabling the insect to overwinter.
Aphids usually appear as the weather begins to warm; they will first be noticed on plant tips, near opening flower and leaf buds. It is a good practice to monitor susceptible plants, and then at first sight simply wash off the plants with a stiff jet of water. Cradle the plant tips in your hand as you wash off the pests. Sticky honeydew and sooty mold and be washed off with a mild soap and water rinse. These two methods are especially recommended for aphid attacks on edible plants. Adult aphids can also be killed by spraying plants with insecticidal soap or with the botanical insecticide neem. Take care to apply these treatments to the stems and the undersides of leaves. Severely infected annuals may not recover from aphid attack; it is perhaps better to dig these out and dispose of them.
Releasing predator insects such as ladybugs and lacewings can be effective in reducing aphid infestations in the spring.
Aphids are attracted to the color yellow, and this can be used against them. Bright yellow plastic dishpans make a good trap when filled with soapy water and set near infested or vulnerable plants.
Properly fed plants tend to be less troubled by aphids. Too much nitrogen can be as bad as too little. Take care to use a well balanced fertilizer and water your plants regularly. Apply thick mulch in the summer to keep soil cool and moist.
Try neem oil for spider mites."

Title: Identifying Common Household Insect Pests | University of Maryland Extension
Key points to help in identifying household insects
Proper identification is the first step prior to managing any pest. Submit photos and questions to Ask Extension if you need assistance.
In most circumstances, an infestation can be brought under control without hiring a pest control company.
Proper identification, sanitation, managing moisture in and around the home, vacuuming, sealing off insect entry points, proper firewood storage, using a dehumidifier are some examples of management techniques to help reduce or eliminate an indoor insect problem.
Avoid using pesticides indoors when at all possible to help minimize exposure. The risk of exposure to toxic materials is much higher indoors than outdoors. Insecticides do not break down indoors nearly as fast as outdoors. Indoors, pesticides are not exposed to degradation by temperature changes, wind, rain, soil microorganisms, etc.
Identification key for insect pests in and around the home
Running, walking, or crawling
Maggot or caterpillar-like
Wood destroying pests
Selecting pest control companies and pesticides
Shop for a pest control company as you would for a doctor or any other professional service.
Begin with recommendations from friends and neighbors.
Most companies provide free estimates, at which time they discuss a treatment plan, cost, and of equal importance warranties.
Compare recommended treatment programs and estimates among several companies.
A number of termiticides are registered for termite control; the use of different compounds and formulations varies among companies. Companies should fully disclose information on the chemical that they will be using in the treatment.
Companies that are members of the Maryland Pest Control Association and the National Pest Control Association have access to all current treatment practices. You can check a company's reputation by calling the Better Business Bureau.
Make certain that the company has an active certification license from the Maryland Department of Agriculture Pesticide Regulation Section.
If you have had a termite problem, it is wise to purchase a contract that includes an annual inspection and re-treatment if necessary. Termite control is difficult. The best company can do the best job and still not completely solve the problem.

User > I have a slight concern about a large Douglas Fir on the edge of our residential lot. It is +/- 130' tall, 34" dbh, surrounded by many spruce. The tree seems vibrant, no hollow sounds when knocking with a mallet, no rot observed with a core, but there are many small branches that appear dead. Some have lichen or moss, so it may have been this way for a while. I have not noticed 'dying branches' in the few years we've been here. It seems to be decent new growth on tips and it produces lots of cones. Some of the lower branches seem to 'droop' and it generally looks different from other Douglas firs within 50 feet of similar age/size. They do not have the same type of dead small branches. Should I be concerned about the condition of this Douglas Fir?

User > I have a variety of peppers: Ají Rico, Fooled you Jalapeño, Mini Belle, Alliance (bell pepper), and almost all of them have curling leaves. I'm trying to figure out if I need to do something to fix the curling pepper leaves. I applied composted horse manure about a month before planting my seedlings (and tilled it). When planting the seedlings, I used Bumper Crop 4-6-3 fertilizer. About 2 weeks ago, I gave the plants some fish fertilizer because they were yellowing after so much rain. When they were seedlings, I bought new grow lamps but didn't realize they were quite hot, and I think I may have had them too close to the plants. My tomato leaves curled while inside but bounced back once I learned what I was doing and moved them further from the heat. My research tells me either a calcium deficiency or too much watering. I have scaled back the watering (trying to go off the rule of sticking my finger in the dirt 1 inch). Should I try some bone meal? (I did just do the 4-6-3 fertilizer again yesterday, 4 weeks since I planted). Or would I need to do a soil test for that? Or any other suggestions for the curling leaves? It's happening in both my potted peppers and the ones in the ground?

User > What are the ants and caterpillars doing on my arborvitae? I planted some 4ish foot arborvitae near my fence last fall. Last week I noticed they were covered in carpenter-like ants. I tried to ID them and they looked like velvety tree ants. I didn’t spot any aphids. I started noticing brown caterpillars as well along with large black-brown lumps attached to tips of the arborvitae. I’m very curious what is going on and if I should yank them out or if they can be saved.

User > New branches taking a right angle turn? This is a Bloodgood Japanese maple. I’ve had the tree for 7 or 8 years. Last fall after the leaves fell I noticed many of the new branches are growing with a distinct right angle on one side of the tree. About 4 years ago I did accidentally introduce verticillium wilt to the tree because I did a no-no and pruned it with dirty shears. Tree did survive and has been growing well since then. Could this be a result of its infection? Tree looked perfectly healthy before dropping its leaves last fall.

Title: How to Prune Japanese Maples - PlantingTree
nsunny days, as it causes more shock damage to the tree. with respect to timing, one question we commonly get is whether or not you can prune in the spring and fall. the answer is yes you can, however, it ’ s a good practice to be cautious when pruning at these times. pruning too heavily in the spring can cause damage to new buds and stunt growth. whereas pruning too late in the season can stimulate new growth which can be quickly damaged by freezing late fall temperatures where to cut when pruning the purpose of pruning is to encourage your tree ’ s natural growth habit. that being said, there are 5 types of branches you may want to consider removing from your japanese maple. - broken, diseased, or dead branches. these need to go for obvious reasons. prune them when you see them, no matter the time of year. - branches growing inward or in the wrong direction. while strange - looking branches can add character to a tree, they can also cause a lot of problems, particularly if they are growing inward. - crossing branches can result in damage to both the bark and the branches. this can encourage disease and pests, which is something you don ’ t want. if you find that you have several branches crossing in one area, you may consider removing a branch or two. - narrow crotches. this is where two branches meet at an angle of less than 45 degrees. remove one of the branches to open up your tree and reduce the possibility of breakage. - crowded branches. removing crowded branches is most important when it involves the crown of the tree. when you remove crowded branches and foliage in this area, it will increase airflow and help your tree breathe better. you can thin these areas by removing one out of every four branches or so. pruning tips & tricks where you cut matters when removing an entire branch, prune at a 45 - degree angle back to the branch collar, but not into it. basically, there shouldn ’ t be much of the branch left but you should never cut flush to the connecting branch or trunk. be sure to use clean, professional pruners for the best results. - do not prune young trees unless absolutely necessary. allow your tree to fully develop and grow into itself for 10 to 15 years before you do any serious pruning. - younger trees often get long, thin, whip - like branches. you may be tempted to prune off these scrawny long branches. however, it ’ s better if you don ’ t. be patient. they will fill out and get lateral branches. if you prune them off you are more likely to get even more of this same branch type. - don ’ t buy a japanese maple that grows too tall for the spot you have chosen. pruning japanese maples to control height is a fight you won ’ t win. it will only encourage faster growth and thinner, weaker branches. - do not prune off more than of the foliage or the crown of your japanese maple. - never over - prune. while aesthetic pruning of japanese maples is certainly an acceptable practice, we advise that you prune when necessary. believe it or not, sometimes less really is more. now you know how to prune japanese maples. just remember to be patient, take your time, and a little pruning maintenance can go a long way. plantingtree has many japanese maple varieties to choose from. from the bloodgood japanese maple to the coral bark maple and the orangeola, shop our premium hand - selected trees anytime at our online plant nursery.

User: Can you help with grass/weed identification? In the last month, I noticed this grass/weed in my yard primarily between the horse pasture and the county road. There is some, but little, of it in my larger healthier yards. The grass/weeds grow a seed head, the leaves look similar to thick fescue, and they turn to a purplish color. I'm trying to identify what they are, so I can better plan for next year.

Title: Hyles lineata - Wikipedia
hyles lineata, also known as the white - lined sphinx, is a moth of the family sphingidae. they are sometimes known as a “ hummingbird moth ” because of their bird - like size ( 2 – 3 inch wingspan ) and flight patterns. [ 2 ] as caterpillars, they have a wide range of color phenotypes but show consistent adult coloration. [ 3 ] with a wide geographic range throughout central and north america, h. lineata is known to feed on many different host plants as caterpillars and pollinate a variety of flowers as adults. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] larvae are powerful eaters and are known to form massive groupings capable of damaging crops and gardens. [ 5 ] as adults, they use both visual and olfactory perception to locate plants from which they collect nectar. [ 6 ] [ edit ] hyles lineata is one of the most abundant hawk moths in north america and has a very wide geographic range. [ 4 ] this range extends from central america to southern canada through mexico and most of the united states. [ 5 ] some regions of south asia like sindh, pakistan are reported to have habitats for these moths. they can also be found occasionally in the west indies. [ 5 ] rarely, specimens have also been reported in eurasia and africa. [ 5 ] [ additional citation ( s ) needed ] the abundance of hyles lineata populations in specific locations varies significantly from year to year, and has been thought to influence selection on flower phenotypes, although studies throughout the years show mixed results. [ 7 ] [ edit ] the forewing is dark brown with a tan stripe which extends from the base to the apex. there are also white lines that cover the veins. the black hindwing has a broad pink median band. it has a wingspan of 2 to 3 inches. this moth is large and has a stout furry body. the dorsal hind region is crossed by six distinct white stripes and similar striping patterns on the wings. the hindwings are black with a thick, red - pink stripe in the middle. [ 8 ] [ edit ] larvae show wide variation in color. the larvae are black with orange spots arranged in lines down the whole body. their head's prothoracic shield, and the anal plate, are one color, either green or orange with small black dots. [ 3 ] a tail - like spine protruding from the back of the body is a typical for sphingid moth caterpillars, known as “ hornworms ”. [ 2 ] this horn, which may sometimes be yellow and have a black tip, is not a stinger, and the caterpillars are not harmful to humans. [ 8 ] the larvae can also sometimes be lime green and black. [ edit ] with such a wide geographic range, h. lineata are known to live in a variety of habitats, including deserts, gardens and suburbs. [ 5 ] they have also been seen in abundance in the mountains of colorado, but their presence varies from year to year in many places. [ 7 ] - willow weed ( epilobium ) - four o'clock ( mirabilis ) - evening primrose ( oenothera ) - purslane ( portulaca ) - four o'clock ( mirabilis ) the adults will feed on different flowers depending on time of day. if at night, they will choose flowers that are white or pale colored

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such"

Title: Your Guide to the Different Types of Cherries and How to Use Them
Wondering which types of cherries are best for pie and which are better for salads and salsas? We've got the answers.
7 Types of Cherries and How to Use Them
When you picture a cherry in your mind, it’s probably a Bing cherry. These red, heart-shaped fruits are juicy and sweet with a touch of acidity, giving them a light tartness that makes them perfectly balanced. They’re great for snacking, and their sweet flavor makes them ideal for simple dessert dishes, like a cherry bounce served over vanilla ice cream, or cherry jam.
As the name indicates, these cherries have a darker skin than most cherry varieties. Black cherry trees are related to the chokecherry, but they’re significantly taller and the fruit is much sweeter. The cherries turn from red to dark purple and almost black as they ripen. They taste great in raw applications like flavored yogurt or baked goods like Black Forest Panettone Pudding.
Montmorency Cherries
These light red, sour cherries are almost exclusively grown in Michigan, making them a popular choice in the Midwest. Their extremely tart flavor makes them less than ideal for snacking but perfect for baking delights like cherry pies. Combine them with sugar for a stellar cherry pie, or use them to make a well-balanced cherry-raspberry jam. They’re also great to make into a delicious tart cherry juice that your health will benefit from.
Morello cherries refer to a family of sour cherries that have become popular for their use in pies and other baked goods. Like Montmorency cherries, Morello cherries are very tart and far too sour for most to enjoy raw. Use them in your favorite sweet-tart recipe or as a sauce to bring out the flavor in your favorite meat dish, like in this Baked Ham with Cherry Sauce recipe. Here are a few other cherry recipes to get started.
These cherries were developed in Washington state in 1952 and named after the state’s largest mountain, Mt. Rainier. They’re pink with a lovely golden-yellow hue and a sweet, almost candied flavor. Cooking these cherries destroys their gorgeous color, so it’s best to enjoy them fresh. Try tossing them into this Chocolate Pear and Cherry Salad or in this Cool Summertime Oatmeal for an added sweetness to your meal.
Maraschino cherries aren’t technically a type of cherry but describe a method of preservation. They were originally made by soaking sour mascara cherries in maraschino liqueur (distilled from the same cherries). Today, they’re made with several different varieties of sweet and sour cherries and are usually preserved in syrup instead of alcohol. They taste more like candy than cherries, but they’re great for garnishing cocktails, like a brandy old-fashioned, and milkshakes, as well as baked goods and sweet desserts like these Cherry Coconut Bars.
The best part of these cherries is that you can enjoy them year-round! You’ll typically find that the dried cherries at your grocery store are made out of tart cherries and come with sweetened and unsweetened options. They’re a versatile version that can be added into just about anything. Have them for breakfast with this Orange Breakfast Souffle, add them into your favorite shortbread cookies or indulge in them when you have a late-night chocolate craving with these Cherry Chocolate Chunk Cookies."

Title: Weed Management in Lawns / Home and Landscape / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)
free of weeds. this is important when planting with seed or sod. perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. for perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules ( stems, rhizomes, and tubers ). it is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules will desiccate on the soil surface. rake off and remove the propagules. if you have particularly troublesome weed problems, continue to work the soil without irrigating for several months to bring up new propagules. a few species such as field bindweed and purple nutsedge cannot be controlled in this manner. a nonselective, systemic herbicide such as glyphosate, applied when weeds are actively growing, can also be used to kill many difficult - to - control perennials, but repeat applications may be needed. soil solarization can be very effective at controlling many weed species prior to planting and is ideal for gardeners who want to avoid herbicide use. once the area is rototilled, amended, and prepared for planting, place clear polyethylene plastic 1 to 2 mils ( 0. 025 - 0. 050 mm ) thick over the moist soil surface, and cover the edges with soil to hold them in place. for best results, soil solarization must be carried out during the time of highest solar radiation — from june to august in inland california — and the tarps must remain on the infested soil for 4 to 6 weeks. solarization is less effective or ineffective in cooler coastal areas or in the shade. many annual weeds can be controlled with this method ; however, soil solarization is not as effective at controlling certain perennials such as field bindweed and nutsedge. refer to pest notes : soil solarization for more information. many soils need to be amended with organic matter or nutrients. amendments can improve drainage in clay soils or improve the water - holding capacity in sandy soils. the ability of soils to drain water and simultaneously hold enough water is extremely important in establishing the turfgrass root system and maintaining healthy lawns. lawns thrive in soils with good drainage that allow the unrestricted flow of oxygen, nutrients, and water. when adding topsoil, make sure it is from a reputable source and that it is free of rocks, weed propagules such as rhizomes or tubers, and herbicide residues. select an appropriate turfgrass species turfgrass species vary in their tolerance to extreme temperatures, shade, drought, and amount of wear. they are divided into two broad categories : cool - season and warm - season grasses, which reflect their temperature preference and periods of active growth. cool - season species such as tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and kentucky bluegrass thrive at 60 - 80°f and may become stressed or go into a semi - dormant state in periods of extreme cold or hot temperatures. they do best in northern and coastal california climates, although there are cool - season grasses grown throughout california. warm - season grasses such as bermudagrass, buffalograss, kikuyugrass, st. augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass grow best in southern california or central valley climates where summers are hot and dry and winters are relatively mild. these grasses go dormant during winter months when soil temperatures drop below 52°f and then green up in spring when soil temperatures rise. in general, cool - season grasses are less drought - tolerant and require 25 % more water than warm - season grasses grown in the same location. when planting a lawn, choose a species that best fits your specific conditions. poorly adapted species are more susceptible to weed invasions and require more intense maintenance than well - adapted species. for more information refer to the publication turfgrass selection for the home landscape, listed in references. it is essential to choose a planting time that allows the turfgrass species to establish quickly and be competitive with weeds. warm - season grasses should be planted from mid - spring to midsummer. cool - season grasses should be planted in early spring or fall. lawns will compete with weeds more effectively if established quickly. lawns established from sod have few weed problems from the moment they are planted. lawns planted from seed, stolons, or plugs can take up to 2 months to become established and are, therefore, more susceptible to weed invasions. weed management in newly planted lawns even if a planting site has been carefully prepared, some weeds will probably develop in a new lawn. remove weeds by hand as they appear. this will prevent them from producing seed and extending the invasion. properly timed irrigation, mowing, and fertilization can keep weeds under control. in the first few weeks after planting turfgrass roots are fairly short, extending only into the top few inches of soil. water lightly to keep the root zone moist without saturating the soil. once the turfgrass becomes established, encourage healthy root growth to deeper depths with deep, infrequent watering. mow new lawns for the first time when their roots are firmly planted in the soil. be sure the soil is fairly dry so that the young turfgrass is not torn from the ground. weed management in established lawns many lawns are watered incorrectly. poor irrigation practices can weaken turfgrass, allowing weeds to invade. annual bluegrass, crabgrass, dallisgrass, and nutsedge are just a few weed species that thrive in poorly irrigated lawns. to maintain a healthy lawn, uniform water coverage is needed. sprinkler heads that are broken, obstructed, or set too low or too high may not reach all areas of the lawn and can result in dry or dead spots in an otherwise healthy turfgrass. in general, deep, infrequent irrigation will encourage healthy root growth. light, frequent watering is only required when the turfgrass has just been planted and the root system is developing. watering established turfgrass lightly and frequently creates a shallow - rooted lawn, making it less durable and allowing shallow - rooted weeds such as crabgrass to get the competitive edge. ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. the top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions."

\n\nwhat's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.\n\nTitle: Invasive Sumac: How to Get Rid of It and Why | Insights\n\nbush and scented sumac — emits a strong smell when crushed. ranging from 2 to 12 feet tall, skunkbush is sometimes planted for windbreak or erosion control. - sugar : native to california and arizona, it features large green leaves with white flower clusters. land damage caused by invasive sumac invasive sumac causes damage to the surrounding environment by growing quickly and aggressively, threatening local ecosystems and putting a strain on native plants and animals. examples of environmental damage caused by sumac include : destroyed vegetation if gone unchecked, sumac can quickly outgrow its area and overtake and displace other vegetation. while the roots are relatively shallow and may only reach about 10 inches underground, many sumac species tend to spread rapidly. sumac aggressively reproduces through seeds and grows in dense thickets, cutting off other plants'access to vital nutrients. another cause of sumac damage is the shade produced by an extensive patch of trees or shrubs. sumac growth can block rain and sunlight and begin to change the ecosystem's soil chemistry, temperature, and light levels. this can cause existing plants and small shrubs in the area to wither. by blocking the sunlight, sumac trees may also prevent new plants and vegetation from growing. many species of sumac naturally attract wildlife due to edible berries, sweet scents, and attractive foliage. when sumac grows rampant and begins to destroy vegetation and land, it can disrupt the surrounding wildlife's natural ecosystem. without the vegetation they depend on for survival, animals native to the region may have to look elsewhere for food. sumac can also replace an animal's natural habitat, forcing them to find other areas to live. how to stop sumac trees from spreading if you ’ ve spotted the telltale signs of invasive sumac, it ’ s important to act quickly. there are three primary methods for getting rid of invasive sumac : - chemical control : since sumac tends to produce colonies of shoots from small sections of roots, it can be difficult to remove via cutting or other mechanical methods alone. applying a chemical or herbicide can help eliminate invasive sumac. - fire : burning is another method for getting rid of sumac. fire will kill the buds along the stem and the growing shoots that are above ground. however, it won't reach the underground buds, creating a temporary solution for preventing sumac damage. - mechanical control : mechanical sumac tree removal is a highly efficient method for managing overgrowth, no matter how it ’ s growing. eradicating sumac through mechanical means requires chopping or mulching trees down as close to ground level as possible, removing saplings by hand, and mowing any root sprouts that break the surface. mulching, using a disc or drum mulcher, is a quick and effective method for taking on sumac. once the trees are mulched, you can then use a stump grinder to remove the remaining stump. photo credit : http : / / www. bobthompson. me / 2018 / 01 / november -

preemergent or postemergence - contact or systemic - selective or nonselective. preemergence herbicides are applied before weeds emerge from the soil ; they kill weed seedlings as they germinate and try to emerge. in lawns they are primarily used against annual grass weeds such as annual bluegrass and crabgrass, but there are also preemergence herbicides that are effective against many broadleaf weeds. postemergence herbicides are applied after weeds have emerged from the soil ; they control actively growing weeds. postemergence herbicides may have either contact or systemic activity. contact herbicides cause localized injury where the chemical comes in contact with the plant and are most successful when applied to young weeds. examples include diquat, carfentrazone, plant oils and herbicidal soaps. in contrast, systemic herbicides move within the plant, causing injury at additional sites in the plant and can control older weeds. examples include glyphosate, quinclorac, triclopyr, or 2, 4 - d, dicamba, and mecoprop mixtures ( active ingredients in many broadleaf weed killers ). selective herbicides kill target weeds without damaging desirable turfgrass species. they are toxic to only certain plants or weeds. for example, 2, 4 - d selectively kills only broadleaf plants and not grasses ; fluazifop selectively kills only grasses and not broadleaf plants. nonselective herbicides kill all or most vegetation including turfgrass. they should only be used prior to planting a lawn, during renovation, or as spot treatments. examples of nonselective postemergence herbicides include diquat ( a contact herbicide ), plant oils ( contact herbicides ), and glyphosate ( a systemic herbicide ). the herbicide you choose will depend on the types of weeds you are trying to control and the tolerance of your turfgrass species. table 2 lists some common herbicides and brand names labeled for use on residential turfgrass lawns or for turfgrass renovation and highlights the types of weeds or special weed problems they control. please note that some of the pesticides mentioned here are available for professional use only, but can be applied on residential lawns. * these are example trade names and not all trade names are listed. trade names and registrations change frequently. not all listed products may currently be registered. although herbicide products containing fertilizers\n\nTitle: Weed Management in Lawns / Home and Landscape / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)\n\n##s. common groundsel. common knotweed. common purslane. crabgrass. creeping woodsorrel / bermuda buttercup. dallisgrass. dandelions. field bindweed. green kyllinga. kikuyugrass. mallows. nutsedge. plantains. spotted spurge. uc anr publications. oakland, ca. wilen ca, le strange m, harivandi ma. 2015. uc ipm pest management guidelines : turfgrass — weeds. uc anr publ. 3365. oakland, ca. -

User > I just got my soil test results and the potassium is off the charts. Literally. The results showed P=180, K=563, Mg=596. I tested the soil in our two raised beds, to be used for vegetables. Last year I ordered a mixture of compost and soil specifically for raised beds from a local farmer, but just tested this year. This farmer also has a septic pumping business, and I suspect this is the source of the excessive P. My question is: what do I do now? Can I plant in these beds and just wait for the P to dissipate, or should I remove this soil and start over? (And if so, what do I do with the waste soil?) What do I do when P is off the charts?

areas where black widows may be established. take proper precautions : wear gloves and pay attention to where you are working. black widow bites are sharp and painful. the victim should go to the doctor immediately for treatment. it is important to recognize this spider and describe the symptoms accurately and fully so the physician can diagnose the trouble correctly. this spider can be cleaned out of an area simply by knocking the webs, spiders, and round, tan egg sacs down with a stick and crushing them under foot. household insect sprays will kill the spiders when hit directly. cobweb spiders are common household spiders that enter homes when they are small. they build irregular webs in areas where insects fly or rest, usually in corners of rooms or windows. when they are active in the web, the web remains relatively inconspicuous, but when these spiders leave a web or die, the web becomes covered with dust and is easily seen. cleaning or dusting in areas frequented by these spiders is sufficient for control. yellow sac spider ( cheiracanthium inclusum ). photo : joseph berger, bugwood. org yellow house spiders are small, about ¼ inch long, and move rapidly. they may be found in all rooms of a house. the spiders enter homes in early fall and are active for several months weaving small white webs in confined spaces where they spend the winter. in the spring, they usually emerge from their white web cells and find their way outside. orb weavers - garden spiders yellow garden spider. photo : edward l. manigault, clemson university donated collection, bugwood. org garden spiders such as the black and yellow argiope aurantia are orb - weaving spiders. orb weavers produce a neat, flat, classic spider web. the web is used to capture prey as these spiders have poor vision. there are more than 2, 500 species of orb weavers in the united states, but one of the most recognizable is the black and yellow argiope aurantia. they are most often seen in late summer and fall. they are large and marked with black and yellow or orange. the web may be up to 2 feet in diameter and stretched across a path, between shrubs or across tall weeds. they are great at catching all kinds of insects including stink bugs that happen to stumble into their webs and unfortunately the occasional butterfly. pennsylvania grass spider - funnel weaver spiders in the mist : funnel weaving spider, pennsylvania grass spider,'agelenopsis pennsylvanica'- dr. mike raupp, professor of entomology, bug of the week brown recluse ( loxosceles reclusa ) - not commonly found in maryland brown recluse spider ( loxosceles reclusa ). photo : ed freytag, city of new orleans, bugwood. org range of recluse spiders in the u. s. map : rick vetter, spiders. ucr. edu this spider is not found in maryland. they are not native here and cannot survive the climate. on rare occasions, they can be brought into the state in moving or shipping boxes. this is a venomous spider principally found in the lower central midwest and the south central united states. bites occur when the spider is inadvertently pressed or touched. the bite of a brown recluse spider causes a wound, which takes 6 weeks or more to heal. in rare instances, it has caused death to sensitive individuals. the brown recluse makes no conspicuous web but moves about rapidly. this spider is very shy and reclusive. indoors, it is typically found in storage areas, closets, and infrequently used clothes and beds, and less utilized areas of a home. the appearance of the brown recluse spider is unique. its body is about ¼ inch long, the legs covering the area of a coin the size of a quarter. the front half of the spider is marked with a violin - shaped design and the rear half of the abdomen is unmarked and tan or brown. all other brown colored spiders this size have either no design at all or have stripes or spots on the front half – never a violin - shaped design. abdomens of other spiders are rarely unmarked but generally exhibit spots, triangles or bands. many different spiders may enter homes, including jumping spiders, yellow house spiders, wolf spiders, and black widow spiders ( rarely ). all spiders are predators and feed on insects or related animals. some species can live in homes feeding on other spiders, flies, ants, and cockroaches. spiders may wander indoors through or around windows, doors, and cracks. they will sometimes move into homes in the fall seeking shelter. caulk cracks and tighten up around doors and windows, especially those at ground level. some spiders live in webs and seldom leave them, while others are active hunters. generally, if you control the spiders'prey, you will control the spiders. the removal of spider breeding places outside the home can help contribute greatly to spider management. trash, piles of lumber, weeds, leaves, flower pots, and any other objects piled or stacked next to the house provide areas where spiders can live and breed undisturbed.

Title: Buck Moth Caterpillar Defoliates Oak Trees | Davey Tree
The buck moth caterpillar is a serious pest that defoliates oaks, particularly in the southeastern United States. The moths have dark gray wings with an irregular, median white band and a crescent-shaped, white mark bordered in black on each wing.
Caterpillars eat the leaves of oak trees, (primarily live oaks, but also water oaks). They are found from Maine to Georgia and west to Texas. The caterpillars destroy a tree’s natural beauty and vigor, making it more susceptible to diseases and insect attacks.
Buck Moth Caterpillar Life Cycle & Symptoms:
Moths emerge from the soil in late fall, post-leaf drop. Each female deposits 70-200 whitish-tan eggs in a cluster encircling the oak twigs. Larvae hatch over a prolonged period starting in early spring and caterpillars can appear before the leaves emerge. By mid-spring, the larvae have undergone 5 growth stages, growing from 1/8” larvae to 2 ½” caterpillars. Caterpillar spines often cause dermal irritation. Young buck moth caterpillars will organize themselves into communities and will even follow each other in a single file. They are often seen migrating across lawns or climbing the sides of buildings in search of places to pupate in the fall. Moths normally appear at the start of deer hunting season, thus the name, buck moth.
Buck Moth Caterpillar Control & Management:
There are several control options, including such biorationals as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) and horticultural oil. Affected trees should also be fertilized with Arbor Green PRO® to improve their recovery and overall vigor.

User > Sick Rhododendrons? I have quite a few rhododendrons planted in a corner of my yard. I have no idea how old they are since they were planted before I acquired the property (which was about 4.5 years ago). They've been growing pretty wild for the last few years and are packed in pretty tightly, but they've always bloomed nicely. This year they don't appear to be blooming at all and most branches have brown tips and leaves are turning yellow and/or have brown spots. I have a number of azaleas planted in the same area and they appear to be unaffected. They're blooming right now just as beautiful as always, with no leaf discoloration. I suspect a fungal infection, but I'm puzzled that the azaleas aren't affected as well. So my question is basically, what do you think this may be and how can I maybe fix it?

User > My blue fothergilla has developed spots all over which has rapidly spread over the past few days and now cover almost the entire plant. One branch has also grown in green from the bottom while the rest of the bush remains blue. I remember these spots from last spring and ended up spraying it with Neem oil, which seemed to address it but caused all of the leaves to lose their blue hue. The plant recovered and kept its leaves. It's been in this position for two years now, which is along a south-facing fence. It's fairly shaded, but that hasn't stopped its growth. What could be the cause of these Blue Fothergilla spots and how can I treat it?

User > I planted 3 white oak whips about 3 years ago. I’m having trouble with one that the tree puts on new growth but looks deformed and dries up and dies. It started out being my strongest tree. I do not spray any chemicals on my property. The problem was starting to show last year but not much. Now there is definitely a problem with die back on white oak. Is there anything I can do or can it correct itself?

Title: Buck Moth Caterpillar Defoliates Oak Trees | Davey Tree
Buck Moth Caterpillar Description:
The buck moth caterpillar is a serious pest that defoliates oaks, particularly in the southeastern United States. The moths have dark gray wings with an irregular, median white band and a crescent-shaped, white mark bordered in black on each wing.
Caterpillars eat the leaves of oak trees, (primarily live oaks, but also water oaks). They are found from Maine to Georgia and west to Texas. The caterpillars destroy a tree’s natural beauty and vigor, making it more susceptible to diseases and insect attacks.
Buck Moth Caterpillar Life Cycle & Symptoms:
Moths emerge from the soil in late fall, post-leaf drop. Each female deposits 70-200 whitish-tan eggs in a cluster encircling the oak twigs. Larvae hatch over a prolonged period starting in early spring and caterpillars can appear before the leaves emerge. By mid-spring, the larvae have undergone 5 growth stages, growing from 1/8” larvae to 2 ½” caterpillars. Caterpillar spines often cause dermal irritation. Young buck moth caterpillars will organize themselves into communities and will even follow each other in a single file. They are often seen migrating across lawns or climbing the sides of buildings in search of places to pupate in the fall. Moths normally appear at the start of deer hunting season, thus the name, buck moth.
Buck Moth Caterpillar Control & Management:
There are several control options, including such biorationals as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) and horticultural oil. Affected trees should also be fertilized with Arbor Green PRO® to improve their recovery and overall vigor.

Title: Pests of Tomato | NC State Extension Publications
a wasp parasite, cotesia congregata. parasitized hornworms are easily recognized by the small, white, oblong cocoons attached to their backs ( figure 22b and figure 22c ). leave these worms in the garden so the emerging wasps can parasitize other hornworms. for chemical recommendations, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. silverleaf whitefly, bemisia argentifolii bellows and perring, aleyrodidae, homoptera adult — the silverleaf whitefly ( figure 23a ) is slightly smaller and slightly yellower than other whiteflies. the female is almost 1 / 16 inch long, and the male is somewhat smaller ( figure 24 ). the wings are held rooflike at about a 45 - degree angle, whereas other whiteflies usually hold their wings nearly flat over the body. hence, the silverleaf whitefly appears more slender than other common whiteflies. egg — the eggs are whitish to light beige with the apex tending to be slightly darker. the eggs are inserted on end into the undersides of new leaves ( figure 23b ). nymph — the nymphal stage appears glassy to opaque yellowish and may or may not have dorsal spines, depending on leaf characteristics. the body is flattened and scalelike, with the margins relatively near the leaf surface ( figure 23c and figure 23d ). pupa — the pupa or fourth nymphal instar is somewhat darker beige - yellow and opaque. pupae are plumper than previous nymphal stages ( figure 24 ). some of the spiracular furrows have a small amount of white wax deposits. the caudal setae are prominent, and the caudal end is somewhat acute. dorsal spines are present when the host leaf is hairy and absent when the host leaf is smooth. the outer edges of the body are rounded. distribution — the silverleaf whitefly occurs around the world in tropical and subtropical areas and in greenhouses in temperate areas. host plants — the number of host plants is extensive. the plant families most often reported as hosts are amaranthaceae, compositae, convolvulaceae, cruciferae, cucurbitaceae, euphorbiaceae, labiatae, leguminosae, malvaceae, moraceae, rosaceae, solanaceae, and verbenaceae. in addition to tomato, the most frequently reported hosts in the southeastern united states are poinsettia and gerbera daisy. damage — adults and nymphs cause direct damage by removing sap. chlorotic spots sometimes appear at the feeding sites on leaves, and heavy infestations cause leaf wilting. the excretion of honeydew and the subsequent development of sooty mold fungi also may reduce photosynthesis and other physiological functions of the plant. even though the silverleaf whitefly is considered an economic pest, little information is known about the damage it causes or the economic thresholds in tomatoes. life history — developmental times from egg deposition to adult emergence vary from 16 to 38 days and appear to be primarily influenced by temperature, humidity, and the host plant. the number of eggs laid by each female over her lifetime varies considerably, but is usually about 90. reports from israel indicate that repeated applications of insecticides have produced a resistant, highly fecund strain of silverleaf whitefly, with the females capable of

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2
light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others."

here are the reasons behind your philodendron leaves turning yellow : - nutritional deficiency - over - fertilization how to fix yellow leaves on philodendron? a philodendron plant doesn't like sitting in water, hence, it ’ s important to remove any excess water from the plant ’ s decorative pot or saucer. overwatering is the most common cause of a yellowing philodendron. the best practice says to water your plant only when its top layer of soil appears dry. use chemical - free ‘ overnight ’ water for best results. since the delicate foliage of philodendrons doesn't do well under the harmful rays of direct sun, it ’ s best to move your plant to a spot with bright, indirect light. to avoid overfeeding your philodendron, use half - strength balanced liquid fertilizer only in the growing season. if your plant has been living in the same soil for a long time, it's likely to get depleted of essential nutrients. the solution is repotting your philodendron in a fresh, nutrient - rich potting mix. why is my philodendron plant turning brown : causes and solutions in this section, we'll look at the common reasons behind your philodendron leaves turning brown, and the easy ways to prevent this. philodendron leaves turning brown : reasons brown spots on philodendron leaves are mostly a result of : - underwatering / overwatering - pests and bacterial diseases - nutritional deficiency - overexposure to sunlight - extreme temperature what to do when philodendron leaves turn brown? to fix brown leaves on a philodendron, adjust your watering routine. ensure the soil is well - draining and water only when the top layer of the soil feels dry. use a pot with drainage holes to prevent water accumulation around the root system. on that note, underwatering your plant can also lead to brown tips, so don ’ t leave it thirsty for prolonged periods. your philodendron will also benefit from medium to high humidity around it. thus, mist its leaves regularly, use a humidity tray, or turn on a humidifier nearby. additionally, keep your plant away from drafts and heating vents. protect your philodendron from hot temperatures and direct sunlight to prevent browning leaves. also, inspect the plant for pests or diseases and treat it with appropriate insecticides or fungicides. why are my philodendron leaves curled? your philodendron leaves may be curled for several reasons, including dry soil, low humidity, watering with heavily chlorinated tap water, and hot temperatures. curling leaves in plants is a natural defense mechanism against moisture loss. so, once you identify the exact reason, you can fix the issue more easily. how do you uncurl philodendron leaves? to uncurl your philodendron's leaves, ensure consistent watering ( especially during the hot summer days ), maintain high humidity around your plant through misting or using a humidifier, and provide bright, indirect light. checking for pests and ensuring a proper balance between soil water retention and drainage will also help promote healthy foliage in your plant. philodendron leaves drooping : reasons and solutions your philodendron may be drooping or wilting, due to inconsistent watering, low humidity, heat or cold - related stress, over - fertilization, transplant shock, and pests. low - light conditions can also cause your philo plant to droop. how do you fix a droopy philodendron? to address your droopy philodendron, check the soil moisture. since overwatering or underwatering can both cause drooping, ensure the soil is slightly moist but not waterlogged. improve drainage if needed. also, provide your green companion with bright, indirect light and maintain a consistent temperature without extreme fluctuations. finally, fertilize once during the growing season to encourage healthy growth and prevent overfeeding. other common philodendron issues some other common issues associated with this beautiful plant include : - philodendron leaves turning mushy : mushy leaves are mostly caused by overwatering or root rot. moderating your watering routine and inspecting your plant's roots for rot is recommended. you may need to repot your philodendron in fresh soil after cleaning the roots. - philodendron burnt leaves : exposure to direct sunlight is the primary cause of your philodendron's burnt leaves. to fix this, move your plant to a spot with bright but indirect sunlight. - philodendron pests and diseases : these plants often face pests like spider mites and aphids, and diseases like fungal root rot or bacterial leaf spot. reduce watering and improve drainage to minimize the risk of diseases. pests can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil and regular plant inspection. how do you revive a philodendron? follow these care tips to revive a dying philodendron : - trim any damaged leaves and stems. - place your plant near a sunny window, which receives bright but indirect sunlight. - keep the environment slightly humid. - feed your philodendron once or twice during the growing season. - regularly hydrate your plant to prevent it from drying. - repot your philo plant in fresh soil if you suspect root rot. - use a well - draining nutrient - rich soil mixed with a bit of perlite. philodendron leaf problems : faqs q : should i cut off brown philodendron leaves? a : yes! brown philodendron leaves are unlikely to become green again, so it would be sensible to cut them off. trim them just above the nodes to encourage the growth of new healthy leaves. q : what does an overwatered philodendron look like? a : symptoms of an overwatered philodendron include wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, mushy foliage and roots, and more. q : how do you know if your philodendron is underwatered? a : your philodendron is underwatered if its leaves turn yellow and brown from the tips. the foliage may also start to drop if your plant is thirsty. hydrate your plant thoroughly as soon as possible. q : how do i know if my philodendron has spider mites? a : if your philodendron has spider mites, you may notice fine ‘ webbing ’ on the leaves, discoloration on the foliage ( brown and yellow spots ), and a general decline in the plant ’ s health. q : how do you make a philodendron bushier? a : trim leggy philodendrons to promote bushier growth. overgrown vining varieties will also benefit from regular pruning. cut back your cascading plant if the vines have become too long. you can use some of the cutting to propagate your philodendron. related : pothos vs philodendron : key differences and similarities although easy to care for, philodendrons can still succumb to various leaf issues and other problems. those often mean incorrect watering, over - or underexposure to sunlight, lack of nutrients, or overfertilization. temperature fluctuations, poor humidity, pests, and diseases can also be the causes behind unhealthy - looking philodendron plants. luckily, most of these problems are fixable by making small adjustments to your plant ’ s care routine. in addition, grouping your philodendrons with other green companions, such as the chinese money plant, areca palm, or the stunning burgundy rubber tree can be beneficial, as this helps maintain good humidity levels around them.

User > I have a dwarf Meyer lemon and dwarf lime tree in containers. I kept them on my deck outside during the summer and now that it's fall, I've been bringing them inside the house on cold days/nights. The last time I "fed" them was in August. Should I still feed my dwarf lemon and lime trees every month throughout the fall/winter or should I stop? My lime has flowered, and I already see two limes. Some of the leaves on the lime tree are yellowing. I don't see any flowers on the lemon tree, and the leaves are green.

be damaged when the temperature drops below, so winter protection is essential. use a general - purpose, cactus and succulent, or citrus potting mix that provides good drainage. repot into fresh potting mix once every three years. container - grown citrus plants need fertilization, particularly with nitrogen. look for a fertilizer that has nitrogen in a 2 - 1 - 1 or 3 - 1 - 1 nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium ( n - p - k ) ratio. you can use an organic granular or slow - release fertilizer or a product labeled “ citrus fertilizer. ” another option is a liquid fertilizer ( such as fish emulsion ) applied when you water. fertilize your plant only when it is actively growing ( spring to late summer ). the frequency of application will depend on the type of fertilizer you choose ( read the product label ). as a general guideline, fertilize citrus at least three times in the growing season : spring, early summer, and late summer. stop fertilizing by early fall. this will prompt your plant to harden off rather than develop new foliage. you do not need to fertilize in the winter. citrus trees produce fragrant white flowers in the spring. some types ( lemons, limes ) will continue to produce flowers from spring to fall. the majority of dwarf citrus plants are self - fertile, so you do not need a second plant for pollination. flowers produced when your plant is outdoors will be pollinated by a variety of insects. when your plant is indoors for the winter, you will have to hand pollinate the flowers in order to initiate fruit development. use a small dry paintbrush to pick up pollen from one flower and brush it from flower to flower. citrus fruits ripen at different times of the year, depending on the type and variety. for example, mandarins ripen from late winter to spring ; meyer lemons ripen primarily from fall to winter but may produce fruits throughout the year. citrus plants naturally shed some of their excess immature fruits. potted plants typically set more fruit than they can support. the shedding of excess fruit is normal. the amount of fruit drop may be alarming ( up to 75 % of fruits may fall off ). fruit drop also occurs as a response to a sudden change in temperature. be patient when it comes to fruiting. a young citrus plant may not bear fruit until after a few years of growth. additionally, fruits on some varieties may take six to nine months to ripen fully. adequate lighting is essential for good fruit development. prune dwarf citrus to maintain a desired height and form. pruning may be done from the time you bring your plant indoors in the fall up until new growth develops in the spring. keep in mind that the timing of pruning will affect flowering and fruiting. broken or dead branches can be pruned out at any time. prune out branches that are damaged, crossing, or growing straight upwards. pruning the central leader branch ( es ) will encourage the development of side branches. prune off suckers growing from below the graft line. some types of citrus ( e. g., meyer lemon, kaffir lime ) produce thorns, which can be pruned off at any time without harm to the plant. other varieties ( e. g., kumquats, some key limes ) are thornless. a citrus plant that is crowded in its pot and declining in overall vigor can benefit from root pruning. root pruning also can be done periodically to maintain your plant in a pot that is sized for easy maneuverability. carefully tip the root ball out of the container. slice the root ball vertically from top to bottom in several places using pruners or a knife, removing the outer 1 to 2 inches of the root mass. use a hand tool to tease apart the remaining roots and repot the plant into fresh potting media. root pruning will stimulate new growth. [ watch a video demonstration of root pruning. ] diagnosing and managing common problems of citrus citrus plants are prone to infestations of scale insects, mites, mealybugs, whiteflies, and aphids. proper lighting, watering, and fertilizing will increase your plant ’ s defenses against these pests. prior to bringing citrus plants indoors for the winter, you can apply a spray of horticultural oil or insecticidal soap labeled for use on houseplants to manage pests. common problems of indoor citrus by christa k. carignan, maryland certified professional horticulturist, coordinator, home and garden information center, january 2020.

EVIDENCE:
Title: Aster Yellows – Wisconsin Horticulture

What is aster yellows?

Aster yellows is a chronic, systemic disease that affects over 300 species of broad-leafed, herbaceous plants in at least 38 families. Members of the aster family (Asteraceae), such as asters, marigolds, Coreopsis and purple coneflower are commonly affected by this disease. Vegetable crops such as carrots and potatoes are also susceptible. Aster yellows occurs throughout North America.

What does aster yellows look like?

Infected plants are typically stunted and twisted, with foliage that is yellow, purple or red. Infected plants are often sterile. Floral parts that are normally brightly colored may be green, and petals and sepals may become puckered and distorted. In purple coneflower, secondary flower heads (often in a cluster) may emerge from the primary flower head. In marigolds, flowers are often leafy and a muddy green-orange color. Infected carrots have purple/red leaves and form taproots with tufts of small, white “hairy” roots. Tap roots from infected carrots often have a bitter taste.

Where does aster yellows come from?

Aster yellows is caused by the aster yellows phytoplasma, a bacterium-like organism that lives in the food-conducting tissue (phloem) of plants. Aster yellows is rarely lethal. Thus, infected perennials can serve as a source of the aster yellows phytoplasma for many years. The aster leafhopper (Macrosteles fascifrons), a common insect, moves the aster yellows phytoplasma from plant to plant.

How do I save a plant with aster yellows?

There is no known cure for aster yellows. Plants suspected of having aster yellows, including weeds such as dandelions, should be removed immediately so that the aster yellows phytoplasma cannot be spread from infected plants to other non-infected plants in the area. Proper diagnosis of aster yellows is important because management of herbicide and eriophyid mite damaged plants does not require plant removal.

How do I avoid problems with aster yellows in the future?

Some herbaceous plants (e.g., geraniums and impatiens), as well as most woody ornamentals, are not susceptible to aster yellows. Therefore these plants should be used in areas where aster yellows is a problem. In landscape settings, attempts to control aster leafhoppers as a means of controlling aster yellows are typically not effective and are not recommended.

User > Could you help me figure out what happened to my half-wilted purple coneflower? It was doing so good (I planted it as a small plant last spring) and then a couple days ago it just flopped. I don’t know if it’s related but when it first came up this spring, there were actually two plants and the second one shriveled up and died when it was still small. It’s planted in full sun (front flower bed, southwest side of the house), mostly clay soil, although we did mix in some amendments to this bed before we planted in it last year. The ground is moist, although I did try watering it. It doesn’t perk up at night when it cools down. I’m wondering if it’s something with the roots, a fungus possibly. In that case, if I have to pull this plant, should I be concerned about planting something else in its place?

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier

grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses : - leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib. - leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature. - growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses. - vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species. - inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns. - seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets. - stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature. - root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons. - habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates. to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities. identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a boat - shaped tip, and a prominent midrib on the upper side. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads through rhizomes, creating a dense, interconnected turf. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : pyramid - shaped panicle with branches that spread outward, containing small spikelets on delicate stalks. - color : deep green to bluish - green. bermudagrass ( cynodon dactylon ) - leaf blade : narrow, flat, and slightly rough on the upper side, with a pointed tip. - growth habit : spreads vigorously through both stolons and rhizomes. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a finger - like arrangement of spikes radiating from a central point, with each spike containing several spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. zoysiagrass ( zoysia spp. ) - leaf blade : narrow, stiff, and sharp, with a fine texture and a tapering tip. the upper side of the leaf blade is often hairy near the base. - growth habit : spreads through both stolons and rhizomes, creating a dense turf. - vernation : rolled. - inflorescence : a slender, branched panicle containing small spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. st. augustine grass ( stenotaphrum secundatum ) - leaf blade : broad, flat, and relatively coarse, with a rounded or tapering tip. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads primarily through stolons, forming a dense, carpet - like lawn. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a spike - like raceme containing several spikelets, often with a purplish hue. - color : medium to dark green. fescue grass ( festuca spp. ) - includes fine fescue and tall fescue - leaf blade : fine fescue has very narrow, needle - like leaves, while tall fescue has broader leaves with a prominent midrib. both have a slightly rough texture on the upper side. - growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps. - vernation : rolled ( fine fescue ) or folded ( tall fescue ). - inflorescence : fine fescue has a panicle - like inflorescence, while tall fescue has a more spike - like inflorescence. both contain small spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a shiny appearance on the upper side and a tapering tip. the leaf edges have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a spike - like inflorescence containing spikelets that are arranged alternately on a central stem. - color : bright green to dark green. by observing these identifying characteristics, you can distinguish between the most common lawn grasses and better understand their growth habits and appearance. keep in mind that variations can occur within each species, and hybrid cultivars may exhibit unique features.

Title: Weed Management in Lawns / Home and Landscape / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)

weeds can occur in all lawns but rarely become problems in well - managed, healthy turfgrass. poor maintenance practices — such as improper fertilization, watering, and mowing — can weaken turfgrass and make it susceptible to weed invasion. total eradication of weeds isn ’ t realistic or necessary for most lawns. with good management practices, a lawn can be vigorous and attractive with little or no herbicide use. why is weed identification important? - different weeds may require different management approaches. - many weed species are associated with lawn conditions, such as overwatering, compacted soil, or low fertility. identifying the weed species can give an indication of the underlying lawn care problem, which can be corrected. - for help identifying weeds, visit ipm. ucanr. edu. prevent weed invasions with proper lawn care. - choose a turfgrass species well adapted for your area or needs. - uniform water coverage is essential ; regularly check sprinkler heads and adjust if needed. - water deeply and infrequently. - when mowing, remove no more than one - third of the leaf blade. mowing height can vary depending on turfgrass species. - fertilize with 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application up to 4 times a year. - heavy traffic can compact soil ; aerate the soil when grass is actively growing. - remove thatch if it is more than half an inch thick. - identify the weed species. - determine if there is an underlying lawn care problem such as improper fertilizing, watering, and mowing, and correct it. - remove weeds by hand when they are young and before they flower, set seed, form vegetative parts, or spread into patches. - overseed, patch, or renovate problem areas within the lawn. - before using an herbicide, address the underlying reason why weeds are invading. what about pesticides? - choose a selective herbicide that is labeled for use against your problem weed and can be used without damaging your turfgrass species. - nonselective herbicides can harm desirable turfgrass and other plants. - contact herbicides damage plant tissue but don't kill plant roots. these herbicides are most successful when applied to young weeds. - for more information on herbicides available for use on lawns, see the uc ipm pest notes : weed management in lawns. download a pdf of this quick tips. descargue un pdf de estos notas breves. pest notes : introduction weeds occur in every lawn, but they seldom become problems in well - managed, vigorously growing turfgrass. proper site preparation and turfgrass selection before planting are essential to give a new lawn a healthy start. once a lawn is established, poor maintenance practices that weaken it — such as improper irrigation, fertilization, or mowing — are the primary factors likely to predispose it to weed invasion. activities that lead to compaction also contribute significantly to turfgrass stress, making it easier for weeds to invade. an integrated weed management program can reduce most weed populations to tolerable levels and prevent large, unsightly weed patches. total eradication of weeds is not a realistic or necessary goal for most lawns and park turfgrass ; however, with proper maintenance a lawn can be practically free of weeds without the extensive use of chemicals. refer to the uc guide to healthy lawns ( see references ) for detailed information about turfgrass management practices. identifying weeds and knowing their life cycles are essential to management. three general categories of weeds may be found in lawns : broadleaves, grasses, and sedges. take care to distinguish weedy grasses from similar - looking lawn grass species. the life cycle of weeds may be annual, biennial, or perennial. annual weeds are commonly identified as either winter ( cool - season ) or summer ( warm - season ) annuals and survive only one season. if not controlled before they flower, they can produce seed that will sprout the following year or sometimes in the same growing season. in mild climates or in lawns that are influenced by microclimates, cool - season annuals may be found growing in summer ( or year - round ) and warm - season annuals may be found growing in winter ( or year - round ). biennial weeds survive for two growing seasons, reproducing vegetatively or by seed ; however, seed is not produced until the second year. perennial weeds survive for many years, and though they produce seeds, many primarily reproduce vegetatively by creeping stems ( stolons and rhizomes ), tubers, or fleshy roots. perennial weeds are the hardest to control once established. the most troublesome weed species in lawns are listed in table 1. for additional weeds, see the turfgrass weed photo gallery. weeds often invade turfgrass that is over - or under - watered, improperly fertilized, improperly mowed, or highly compacted. lawns that have been weakened by plant diseases or insect pests are also likely to become weedy because there is more open space for a weed to establish. most weed invasions can be prevented with proper lawn maintenance and good preventive practices or remedied with overseeding. the most troublesome weed species that invade turfgrass are often associated with specific conditions ( see table 1 ). identifying the weed species present may give an indication of the underlying problem responsible for the invasion and suggest what can be done to reduce the weed infestation. for detailed information about the major weed species listed in table 1, refer to the pest notes listed in references. weed management before planting a healthy lawn begins with a properly prepared site. before planting, remove existing vegetation and prepare the area for planting. if you expect annual weeds to be a problem, irrigate the site to allow weeds to germinate. follow up with a shallow cultivation or an application of a nonselective herbicide ( defined below ) such as glyphosate or clove oil, and repeat this process until the area is free of weeds. this is important when planting with seed or sod. perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. for perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules ( stems, rhizomes, and tubers ). it is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules are easier to remove. once the site is weed - free, plant the new lawn with a mix of grass species that are well adapted to your area and needs. this will give the new lawn the best chance of establishing a healthy root system and resisting weed invasion.

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and yew, are commonly grown as formal hedges but cannot be renovated in this way. do not prune these shrubs back into dead portions of the branches, as this will create large open gaps in the hedge, and these species do not readily fill in those gaps with new growth. if these hedge species become too large or unattractive, they will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. pruning overgrown evergreen shrubs large, overgrown evergreen shrubs with scale and needle - like foliage, such as juniper and pine, and some with broad leaves, like boxwood, are a more complex problem. large evergreen shrubs possess bare or dead zones in their centers. they cannot be pruned back severely because they are incapable of initiating new growth from bare branches. this means that these shrubs can only be reduced in size to a certain extent, as they should only be pruned back to green areas. do not prune evergreen shrubs back into dead portions of the branches. any large hole or gap in the canopy revealed by pruning will always remain. large, overgrown junipers, spruces, pines, or other conifers that have become too large or unattractive will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. some species, such as yew and, to a lesser extent, boxwood and arborvitae, can initiate some new growth from bare stems and may eventually fill in, but this process can take a considerable amount of time. this means these evergreen shrubs, when severely pruned, may be unattractive for five or more years, and some may never fully fill in. often, it is best to remove and replace even these shrubs to maintain an attractive planting.

"Will a 30+ year old white pine tree tolerate having its exposed roots covered with topsoil and grass seed?"
 
1. White pines are generally considered to be more sensitive to root disturbance than other evergreen tree species. 
2. If the roots are exposed for an extended period, it can cause significant stress to the tree, potentially leading to decline or death. 
3. However, if the roots are covered with topsoil and grass seed, it may help to reduce stress and promote root growth. 
4. The key factor is the age of the tree; if the tree is over 30 years old, it may be more resistant to root disturbance. 
5. It's also important to consider the specific growing conditions of the tree, including soil type, moisture levels, and sunlight exposure.

User > My Carex oshimensis "Evergold" has a lot of brown leaves this year. Is this normal or indicative of a problem? I've had two of the plants for a number of years and haven't seen brown leaves before. During this hot and dry summer, I watered them well - twice a week on average. This spring, the plants were very long and dragging on the ground, so I cut off approximately 1/3 of their length. That was a first for me so I wonder if I shouldn't have done that. In the attached photo, the browning is worst on the middle plant; it can be seen better if you zoom in.

User > Please answer the following user question. You should first analyze the provided image, mentioning any visible clues or observations. Then, present the identification result. Write the entire content as one coherent paragraph (analysis + results). 
User: Identifying a yew: Our home has several seemingly very old yew trees on the shaded north side of the house. We bought the home 2 years ago so we don't know the tree's history. However, we love these trees and have asked numerous people, including our landscaper and arborist, what variety of yew they are. We would like to plant more as a few of the trunks have died back. Most say an upright Japanese yew as they are upright. However, they are quite tall; as tall as the 2 story house. None of the nurseries or online varieties mention them getting even close to that tall. Also, when we research Japanese yew they are all very conical and restrained, and it's hard to imagine that even a very old unkempt one would grow this wild looking. We like that it grows tall and not so "shaped". A retired forester neighbor thought it might be a "Canada Yew" which we can no longer get in this country but when I research that I don't find anything even close to what we have. A Canada yew is very low growing and spreading. Can you tell me what we have and where I might find more? Or lacking that, a similar yew that is upright, tall and not overly restrained?

by beowulf brower and the state parks arbor crew how do you identify a yew? compared to most of our trees, the yew is tiny. most grow to a height of only about 60 feet and seldom exceed 20 inches in diameter. the bark, especially on the older trees, is unlike anything found in the region. it forms as irregular scales of reds, purples and browns. they don ’ t have a set growth pattern either : they may look like an overgrown shrub, a perfect miniature of a bigger conifer or something in between. yew needles are a waxy dark green with a flat appearance. they rise from the trunk or the middle of the branches. this dark color and seemingly random growth are adaptations so the yew can survive in shade where there ’ s less competition from its bigger, light - loving neighbors. the needles are not too distinct otherwise, but the cones are another story! the yew cone looks like a berry. but that red “ berry ” is actually a modified wooden scale known as an aril. this foil allows the yew to tempt birds to aid the yew ’ s reproduction. birds eat the yummy - looking arils, which pass right through, leaving the seed undamaged and deposited far from its parent. the undamaged seed is good for the tree and the bird, as the seeds are toxic. in other words, please don't eat them! the yew is thought to be poisonous because of livestock poisoning reports in the western hemisphere, but many wild animals ( like moose in idaho and elk and deer in oregon and washington ) browse on yews, making it an important food source in the forest. due to its low height, it remains accessible to wildlife throughout its centuries - long life span. the yew has a storied and fascinating history of medicinal use. the last century saw the discovery of paclitaxel, a compound extracted from the bark of the pacific yew, which became the basis for the widely used cancer drug taxol. fortunately, the population of yews wasn ’ t decimated to make taxol. the northwest forest plan, which codified protections for old - growth forests where yews commonly grow, was passed in 1994, and a synthetic version of taxol became available in the early 2000s. the gift from this tree has helped to treat over a million people to date. a slow and steady growth cool fact : a douglas fir that sprouts today will, in 50 years, be larger than a yew 10 times that age. for the yew, longevity and tenacity are not represented by size, but by structure. the largest known pacific yew was found to have grown less than an inch in diameter over 30 years. this tree is nearly five feet in diameter, so you do the math! ok, we ’ re here to help : our back - of - the - napkin math puts this tree at well over 1, 000 years old. it ’ s hard to tell a yew ’ s age by counting rings. the wood is resistant to decay, but centuries of attacks by pathogens can leave the oldest trees hollow. given the strength of the wood, this is usually of little consequence to the yew. if they age slowly, they reproduce just as slow. remember the bright red arils and birds that eat them? after the bird passes the seed, that seed can take months to germinate and years to establish itself, meaning any disturbance to a yew population may have long - lasting impacts. looking to the future though much of the pacific yew ’ s traditional range has been altered by human development, ongoing conservation efforts aim to protect the remaining old - growth forests and the yew trees that live there. while sensitive to climate change, the yew population in western washington is secure. their biggest risk from climate change is increased wildfire. regardless of which park you ’ re in, you ’ re ( usually ) unlikely to find pacific yews near the road. to find the really interesting ones, you ’ ll need to venture deep into forests where they grow protected by the tall canopy above them. once your eye is tuned into their unique form, you ’ ll begin to see them easily wherever they grow. originally published february 19, 2025"

Title: Diseases and pests on Douglas fir - waldwissen.net
 
spp., polydrusus spp. ) sometimes feed on young Douglas fir needles. feeding on the shoots causes damage similar to that of late frost due to the brown colouring of the youngest needle class and is sometimes conspicuous, but is usually minor. noticeable increment loss mostly occurs in forest nurseries. the pine processionary moth ( thaumetopoea pityocampa ) can infest Douglas firs as well as pines. it is found on the southern side of the Alps as well as in Valais and the Lake Geneva area. from the pole wood stage onwards, the distinct, fist - sized hibernation nests of the caterpillars can then be observed in the tree crowns. however, feeding in the crowns is mostly insignificant and damage is usually negligible ; to date, major feeding damage has only been observed on younger pines or in monocultures. the pine processionary moth could become a serious danger to the Douglas fir, however, should the caterpillars'preference for Douglas fir needles observed in the laboratory replicate itself in the field. bark beetles are also found on Douglas firs. the fir bark beetle ( pityophthorus pityographus ) is by far the most common insect to nest in pre - weakened young Douglas firs, causing them to die. the star - shaped breeding gallery of this small bark beetle species is recognisable by the way the mating chambers clearly sink into the sapwood. the fir bark beetle occasionally also appears with the six - toothed spruce bark beetle ( pityogenes chalcographus ). sometimes both species are seen on the same Douglas fir. other native softwood bark beetles can also be found on Douglas fir from time to time, mainly in horizontal infestations. in Switzerland, the larger eight - toothed European spruce bark beetle ( ips typographus ), the large larch bark beetle ( ips cembrae ), the grained spruce bark beetle ( cryphalus abietis ), the striped ambrosia beetle ( xyloterus lineatus ) and the black timber bark beetle ( xylosandrus germanus ), which has become naturalised from East Asia, have already been found on Douglas firs. in addition, several other native forest insects, mainly butterflies and beetles, have taken Douglas fir as their host tree in Europe. so far, however, there have been no reports of damage in Switzerland in this respect. some insect species migrated with their host tree in the 19th century and have become established here. the Douglas fir seed chalcid ( megastigmus spermotrophus ) is one example. unlike in America, however, the chalcid does not cause significant seed loss here. as in North America, the chalcid is only found in the Douglas fir. other newcomers are the Cooley spruce gall adelgid ( gilletteella cooleyi ), the western conifer seed bug ( leptoglossus occidentalis ) and the Douglas fir needle midge ( contarinia pseudotsugae ). the Cooley spruce gall adelgid likes to suck on Douglas fir needles in the young stand and thicket stage, causing the needles to become bent and / or discoloured and resulting in defoliation. this is particularly severe when combined with rhabdocline needle cast, as the trees cease to be competitive and then die.

User > What is a remedy for a newly planted Nuttall Oak tree planted below grade? I had 2 beautiful Nuttall Oaks planted mid-May. Although they both appear healthy, the one in the front is about 3 inches below grade. My front yard has an obvious slope toward the street. I had an arborist come check on them, and she suggested lifting the one in the front a few inches. Prior to her visit, I had already exposed both root collars, and we are about to treat both for Phytophthora. I am worried that pulling the front tree up this winter will cause more damage and would like to find another solution if one exists. Would vertical mulching be better? They have only been in the ground since mid-May. Both trees are about 3 to 4 inches in diameter and about 12 to 15 feet tall, way too heavy for me to address. Several men might be able to lift it enough to build up the ground below, but that much manhandling also concerns me. Any suggestions or other options?

Title: Oak - Nuttall – Plant Me Green
USDA Hardiness Zones: 6-9.
The Nuttall oak is a strong and adaptable oak that provides summer shade and nice fall foliage. The Nuttall is also an important species for wildlife management due to its high production of acorns. The acorns are oblong, brown, ¾ to 1½ inches long and covered by a turbinate (bumpy) cap. A Nuttall Oak tree must be approximately 20 years old before producing acorns. It has a medium growth-rate and reaches a height of 60-80 feet with a canopy of 35-50 feet. In the fall, the leaves turn from yellow to orange to red. This species is one of the most well-adapted oaks for general landscape use. It grows quickly, develops a good branching structure, tolerates wet soil as well as moderate drought, and has very few issues with insects and disease. All of which make the Nuttall oak a great choice for urban and suburban spaces. It is hardy in USDA Zones 6-9.

Title: What to Do After a Tick Bite | Ticks | CDC
- If you find a tick attached to your skin, simply remove the tick as soon as possible.
- There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of tweezers works very well.
- If you develop a rash or fever within several days to weeks after removing a tick, see your doctor.
How to remove a tick
If you find a tick attached to your skin, remove the tick as soon as possible. Do not wait to go to a healthcare provider to remove the tick. Delaying tick removal to get help from a healthcare provider could increase your risk of getting a disease spread through tick bites, known as tickborne diseases.
- Grasp the tick as close to the skin's surface as possible using clean fine-tipped tweezers. If fine-tipped tweezers are not available, use regular tweezers or your fingers to grasp the tick. Grasp the tick close to the skin's surface to avoid squeezing the tick's body.
- Pull tick away from the skin with steady, even pressure. Don't twist or jerk the tick. This can cause the tick mouthparts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, your body will naturally push the mouthparts out over time as your skin heals. You can also remove the mouthparts with tweezers. If you cannot remove the mouthparts easily with tweezers, leave them alone.
- Dispose of the live tick by taking one of these steps: place it in a sealed container; wrap it tightly in tape; flush it down the toilet; or put it in alcohol. Do not crush the tick with your fingers.
- After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with soap and water, rubbing alcohol, or hand sanitizer.
- If you find a tick attached to you, there may be other ticks on your body. Do a careful tick check to look for other ticks and promptly remove them.
People who have removed a tick sometimes wonder if they should have it tested to see if it is infected. Although some commercial groups offer testing, in general this is not recommended, because:
- Laboratories that conduct tick testing are not required to have the high standards of quality control used by clinical diagnostic laboratories. Results of tick testing should not be used for treatment decisions.
- Positive results showing that the tick contains a disease-causing organism do not necessarily mean that you have been infected.
- Negative results can lead to false assurance. You may have been unknowingly bitten by a different tick that was infected.
- If you have been infected, you will probably develop symptoms before results of the tick test are available. If you do become ill, you should not wait for tick testing results before beginning appropriate treatment.
However, you may want to learn to identify various ticks. Different ticks live in different parts of the country and transmit different diseases.
If you develop a rash or fever within several weeks of removing a tick, see your doctor:
- Tell the doctor about your recent tick bite,
- When the bite occurred, and
- Where you most likely acquired the tick.
- The Tick Bite Guide is an interactive tool that will assist individuals on removing attached ticks and determining when to seek health care, if appropriate, after a tick bite.
- The online mobile-friendly tool asks a series of questions covering topics such as tick attachment time and symptoms. Based on the user's responses, the tool then provides information about recommended actions and resources."

User > Is the Ornamental Cherry tree (Prunus subhirtella Autmunalis) declining quickly possibly due to Leucostoma canker? The tree was planted about a year ago, leafed out and flowered but is quickly declining. Any other ideas on disease? It does not present as lack of water stress and surrounding trees are doing ok. This is a high-value 4" tree so we would like to save it.

Reversion of variegated leaves occurs in many types of plants. This is when the white shading or lighter speckles and borders turn into green. This is frustrating to many gardeners, as the variegated forms of plants provide increased interest, brighten dim areas, and are bred specifically to enhance this trait. Variegation loss in plants may be due to lighting, seasonality, or other factors. It is not possible to reverse the loss of variegation, but you can usually keep it from taking over an entire plant.
Reversion of Variegated Leaves
Variegation may be the result of a natural anomaly or carefully engineered breeding. Whichever the case, variegated leaves may turn completely green for a number of reasons. The coloring results from unstable changes in the leaf's cells. One of the most common variegated plant problems is limited chlorophyll in the leaves. Less chlorophyll means less solar energy, as it is a primary component in photosynthesis. Variegated plants are less vigorous than green specimens are. The tendency for reversion of variegated leaves is a protective adaptation that allows the plant to return to a more successful form.
Why Does Variegation Disappear?
Loss of variegation is a frustrating condition for the gardener. Why does variegation disappear? The plant may do it as a survival tactic. It may also occur due to another leaf cell mutation. Variegated plants growing in shady or semi-shady locations are really at a disadvantage. Not only do they have low levels of chlorophyll, but they are not even exposed to adequate light. This scenario lends itself to the reversion of variegated leaves. Variegation loss in plants could also be spurred by changes in heat or cold. If the weather is unfavorable to a particular plant, it may revert just to get a competitive advantage. Once the leaves revert to all green, the plant can increase its harvest of solar energy, which in turn gives it more fuel to produce bigger and stronger growth. Waterlogged plants may also turn back and new shoots often come out green.

Variegated plants tend to be less hearty and vigorous as compared to their completely green cousins. They have no more or less general problems, but some plants can produce albino growth. This type of growth cannot gather solar energy and will eventually die back. If all the new growth becomes albino, the plant will not survive. This is the very opposite of the reversion process. Variegated plants also have smaller leaves, less tolerance to shady areas and yet a tendency to burn in the hot sun, and slower growth. Most plants will only revert on the stem, branch, or another area. You can cut these off to try to prevent the entire plant from reverting. This usually works to slow the production of green leaf cells. If that doesn't work, embrace your healthy, beautiful green chimera of a plant.

User > New trees with leaf damage, what should we do? We planted some Shumard oaks and Green Orchard Maples last Fall and they both have leaf damage of brown, dry areas. We believe they may have suffered from sun scorch because we had some very dry winds blow through before we mulched for the summer and before we increased our watering schedule. Is this a correct diagnosis and is there anything else we should do at this point? Also, does this reflect on the survivability of the tree?

User > I am trying to grow Bluebell grapes. One of my grape plants appears to be OK, but the other grape plant looks sickly (yellowish, wilting leaves). Can I try replanting the sickly grape after digging a larger hole and amending with compost and better soil; or do a partial mounding (crown raised a few inches above ground)? The soil is still somewhat 'gooey' even after several days without rain. The grade surrounding the grape vines does slope toward the vines so it is not well drained even though I am on a gentle southeast facing hillside. I will attach a couple of pictures of the two grape vines. I have an apple tree and a plum tree in the same soil that are doing quite well. I did lose a North Star cherry due to these soil conditions. Any thoughts on improving the conditions for growing grapes would be appreciated.

Title: Pruning Willow Trees - Learn About Trimming A Willow Tree | Gardening Know How
Willow trees need special pruning that begins while the tree is young. Proper pruning helps establish a graceful growth pattern and prevents damage as the tree grows. Let's find out how to prune a willow tree.
Willow trees are more durable and have a better shape if you do most of the pruning and shaping while the tree is young. Pruning willow trees properly while they are young and easier to prune means you probably won't have to make major changes in the tree's structure when it is older and more difficult to prune.
Willow trees bleed sap if you prune them while they are actively growing, so the best time for willow tree pruning is in winter while the tree is dormant. Make sure you have the right tools for the job before you begin. Hand pruners are the tool of choice for small twigs and thin, whip-like stems that are no more than one-half inch (1 cm.) in diameter. For stems up to 1 1/2 inches (4 cm.) in diameter, use long-handled loppers. The longer handles give better leverage for cleaner cuts. Use a saw for anything larger.
Shaping a Young Tree
When trimming a willow tree sapling, the goal is to develop a strong central leader, which will later become the trunk of the tree. You also want to remove branches that are too close together as well as weak branches that are likely to break when they mature and become heavy. Here are the steps in shaping a willow tree:
- Remove any damaged or broken branches. Make the cuts where the branch attaches to the trunk.
- Choose a tall, upright stem at the top of the tree as a central leader, and remove competing stems.
- Remove branches that grow up instead of out. A narrow crotch angle between the branch and the trunk makes it likely that the branch will break as the tree grows and the branch becomes heavy.
- Remove crowded branches. The result should be branches that are evenly spaced around the tree.
- Remove the branches from the lower part of the tree when the trunk reaches a diameter of 2 inches (5 cm.)."

Beets are one of the easiest and most rewarding root vegetables to grow. with their vibrant colors, earthy flavor, and edible greens, they bring both beauty and nutrition to your garden. but to get the best results, companion planting with beets can make all the difference. knowing which beets companion plants to grow nearby — and what not to plant with beets — helps you deter pests, attract beneficial insects, and make the most of your garden space. this guide explores the best and worst companion plants for beets, explaining how each relationship affects your crop and how to plan your garden for strong, healthy plants all season long. and if you're looking to expand your garden with something new, check out these unique beet varieties to cultivate in your garden for added color, flavor, and interest. understanding beetroot companion planting beetroot companion planting is based on the idea that some plants naturally help each other grow, while others compete for nutrients or attract unwanted pests. certain companions loosen the soil, provide shade, or repel insects, while some plants can actually hinder beet growth. beets are a root vegetable that prefer full sun and loamy, well - drained soil rich in organic matter. because they have shallow roots and grow relatively quickly, they pair well with crops that won ’ t crowd them or compete for nutrients. you can start with beet seeds directly in the garden, in raised beds, or even in containers. whether you ’ re new to beet growing or expanding your existing patch, understanding the benefits of companion planting will help you grow stronger, healthier plants. best companion plants for beets let ’ s start with the good guys — the great companions that help your beets thrive. 1. onions and shallots : natural pest control allies onions and shallots are excellent beets companion plants because their strong scent deters pests like aphids and flea beetles. the sulfur compounds they release confuse insects that target beets, providing natural pest control without chemicals. plant onions or shallots between rows of beets to maximize garden efficiency. since onions have upright growth and shallow roots, they won ’ t interfere with beetroot development. you can learn more about this pairing in companion planting the best plants to grow with shallots. 2. lettuce : a living ground cover lettuce and beets make wonderful neighbors. lettuce acts as a ground cover, keeping the soil cool and moist while reducing weed growth. in return, beet plants loosen the soil and improve aeration for lettuce roots. sow lettuce seeds between beet rows, spacing them about 6 inches apart. because lettuce matures quickly, it ’ s usually harvested before the beets reach full size — meaning both crops can share the same growing conditions without competing for nutrients. 3. bush beans and pole beans : nitrogen boosters beans are classic good companions for beets, but it ’ s important to know which types work best. bush beans and pole beans are legumes that fix nitrogen in the soil, helping nearby beets develop strong roots and lush beet leaves. bush beans tend to be better companions for beets than pole beans since they occupy less vertical space and are easier to manage. however, pole beans can still work well if you train them vertically to avoid shading your beets. 4. garlic and chives : powerful pest deterrents garlic and chives are another beet companion group worth planting. like onions, they have a strong scent that deters pests like aphids and flea beetles. garlic also helps prevent fungal diseases by releasing natural antibacterial compounds into the soil. for more ideas, check out companion planting with garlic : what works best for practical tips on pairing garlic with root crops. 5. herbs and flowers : attract beneficial insects herbs such as dill, mint, and basil can attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and parasitic wasps that help keep beet pests under control. meanwhile, flowers such as marigolds and nasturtiums not only beautify your garden but also repel harmful insects. these plants promote biodiversity and balance in your garden ecosystem, which leads to healthier, more resilient beets. 6. swiss chard : a close relative with shared needs swiss chard and beets belong to the same plant family ( chenopodiaceae ) and thrive in similar growing conditions. while they can be grown near each other, it ’ s best to avoid crowding them too closely since they may compete for nutrients if the soil isn ’ t rich enough. with careful spacing and proper crop rotation, both can coexist beautifully, adding color and nutrition to your garden. 7. corn : a shade partner in hot climates if you live in a warm region, tall crops like corn can provide partial shade to beets, keeping them cool during hot afternoons. beets appreciate moderate shade in high heat, and corn benefits from the open soil beneath beet plants. learn how traditional systems like the three sisters companion planting method make use of such beneficial plant relationships. worst companion plants for beets ( what not to plant with beets ) while many plants grow happily beside beets, others can create serious problems. here are some bad companion plants for beets to keep separate. 1. brassicas ( broccoli, kale, cauliflower, brussels sprouts ) brassicas are classic examples of what not to plant with beets. crops like broccoli, kale, and brussels sprouts are heavy feeders, drawing large amounts of potassium and phosphorus from the soil — two nutrients essential for beetroot development. this intense competition for nutrients can result in small, weak roots and yellowing leaves. additionally, some brassicas release root chemicals that inhibit beet seed germination. to avoid this, plant beets and brassicas in different areas of your garden and rotate them annually to maintain soil health. 2. field mustard and other strong - rooted crops field mustard and other plants with aggressive or deep roots can disrupt beet growth by crowding and drying out the soil. beets prefer loose, evenly moist soil to grow their roots evenly — avoid pairing them with anything that will overtake that space. 3. certain nightshades tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants can attract pests and diseases that may spread to beets. if you do want to grow them nearby, leave adequate spacing and maintain strong pest control practices, such as using soaker hoses to water at the root level and reduce leaf moisture. tips for successful beet companion planting 1. prioritize soil health healthy soil means healthy beets. enrich your garden with organic compost and use mulch to retain moisture. to optimize root growth, explore maximizing beet yield : advanced soil preparation and fertilization tips. 2. practice crop rotation rotate your beets each season to prevent soil - borne diseases and nutrient depletion. beets shouldn ’ t follow other root crops or heavy feeders in the same bed. learn seasonal timing and rotation strategies in seasonal beet cultivation strategies for year - round harvests. 3. optimize garden space use intercropping to make the most of limited garden space. pair fast - growing greens like lettuce or herbs between beet rows. for small - space gardeners, growing beets in urban gardens : tips and techniques offers excellent insights. beets companion planting is one of the most effective ways to grow healthier, tastier roots naturally. by choosing good companion plants for beetroot — such as onions, lettuce, and beans — and avoiding poor companions like brassicas, you ’ ll create a thriving, balanced ecosystem that supports both yield and soil health. whether you ’ re planting in large garden beds or small urban spaces, smart beetroot companion planting brings lasting rewards : vibrant crops, fewer pests, and a more harmonious garden. faqs : about beet companion planting what do beets like to be planted by? what is the best way to plant beets? can beets and tomatoes be planted next to each other? what pairs well with beetroots? what should you not plant next to beets? what month is best to plant beets? do beets like sun or shade? do i need to soak beet seeds before planting? what fertilizer is best for beets? are coffee grounds good for beet plants? what are some unique beet varieties to grow?

Title: How to Grow and Care for Lungwort
rejuvenate with fresh growth. you can also prune off leaves that degrade from especially hot or dry weather, as needed. some gardeners choose to simply mow off the tops of the plants as they go dormant during the dry, hot, midsummer period. if kept well-watered, the plants will rejuvenate as the weather cools. propagating lungwort most modern pulmonaria varieties are hybrids that are not generally propagated from seeds. instead, propagation is best accomplished by root division : after a mature plant is done flowering, carefully dig up the entire root ball while keeping the roots intact. wash off the dirt to expose the roots. gently pull apart the clump with your fingers, separating the roots into pieces. discard woody sections. replant the divisions and water them in thoroughly. potting and repotting lungwort growing lungwort in pots or containers is not worth the trouble. the plants will not perform as well as they would in a moist, shady garden location. common pests & plant diseases lungworts don’t have any notable pest or disease problems. but they can be prone to powdery mildew and slug damage, which results in abnormal and damaged foliage. powdery mildew is not generally fatal, but it can be treated with a spray fungicide. overwintering lungwort is best covered with mulch after the ground freezes in the winter. this will moderate freeze-thaw cycles and ensure that roots survive the winter. this is especially necessary in zones 3 and 4, where winters can be quite bitter with rapid cycles between temperature extremes. how to get lungwort to bloom lungwort is grown primarily for its foliage but has attractive flowers. to get lungwort to bloom, provide the right amount of sun and shade, keep the soil consistently moist, and maintain proper soil ph levels. bloom months lungwort blooms towards the end of winter to early spring. how long does lungwort take to bloom? lungwort blooms quickly once it flowers, but flowers fade quickly, leading to the beautiful foliage the plant is known for. what do lungwort flowers look and smell like? lungwort's flowers are bell- or funnel-shaped with five petals, usually starting out pinkish in color then maturing to a violet blue. flower color, however, can vary by species and cultivar. lungwort has a sweet, watery smell that many compare to a cucumber. how to encourage more blooms removing dead leaves and growth can not only make lungwort more visually appealing, but also it can prolong the bloom period. common problems with lungwort lungwort needs fairly precise conditions to flourish, but if those are provided, they are easy to grow and will give you few problems. however, gardeners who are new to this plant are sometimes troubled by the way it dies back when the weather turns hot and dry in midsummer. this is fairly natural with this plant and not a cause for concern. cutting back the plants and keeping them moist (but not soggy) usually encourages them to return as hot summer weather begins to cool in the fall. faq how did lungwort get its name? lungwort (pulmonaria spp.) got its common name because its leaves are shaped like lungs, and the plant was indeed once used medicinally to treat lung ailments.

Title: Phlox | Texas Plant Disease Handbook
Leaf Spots (fungi – Ascochyta spp., Cercospora spp., Macrophoma spp., Phyllosticta spp., Ramularia spp., Septoria spp., and Stemphylium spp.): Septoria divaricata is among the most common and most destructive. It attacks primarily the lower leaves, producing dark brown, circular spots up to one-fourth inch in diameter, the centers of which are light gray, almost white. Infected leaves dry up and die prematurely. For control, spray periodically with recommended fungicides and burn infected leaves.
Powdery Mildew (fungi – Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca humuli): White or grayish moldy growth on upper side of older leaves. Leaves gradually die, beginning on the lower part of the plant. For control, spray with recommended fungicides as soon as the mildew appears.
Rust (fungi – Puccinia douglasii and Uromyces acuminatus f. spp. polemonii): Neither rust is important enough to warrant control. Both rusts appear on leaves as raised blisters or pustules covered with a brown coating that ruptures releasing the brown spores.
Cotton Root Rot: (See the section on Cotton Root Rot)
Crown Rot (fungi – Sclerotium spp., Rhizoctonia spp. and Thielaviopsis spp.): These fungi are destructive on seedlings. They cause a rotting of the plant at the soil line. Sterilizing potting soil is the best control.
Wilts (fungus – Verticillium albo-atrum): (See the section on Wilt)
Crown Gall: (See the section on Crown Gall)
Aster Yellows (mycoplasma): Flower petals often show white steaks and vein banding. Clusters of flowers or individual petals may turn into green, leafy structures.

Title: How to Prune Japanese Maples - PlantingTree
nsunny days, as it causes more shock damage to the tree. with respect to timing, one question we commonly get is whether or not you can prune in the spring and fall. the answer is yes you can, however, it ’ s a good practice to be cautious when pruning at these times. pruning too heavily in the spring can cause damage to new buds and stunt growth. whereas pruning too late in the season can stimulate new growth which can be quickly damaged by freezing late fall temperatures where to cut when pruning the purpose of pruning is to encourage your tree ’ s natural growth habit. that being said, there are 5 types of branches you may want to consider removing from your japanese maple. - broken, diseased, or dead branches. these need to go for obvious reasons. prune them when you see them, no matter the time of year. - branches growing inward or in the wrong direction. while strange - looking branches can add character to a tree, they can also cause a lot of problems, particularly if they are growing inward. - crossing branches can result in damage to both the bark and the branches. this can encourage disease and pests, which is something you don ’ t want. if you find that you have several branches crossing in one area, you may consider removing a branch or two. - narrow crotches. this is where two branches meet at an angle of less than 45 degrees. remove one of the branches to open up your tree and reduce the possibility of breakage. - crowded branches. removing crowded branches is most important when it involves the crown of the tree. when you remove crowded branches and foliage in this area, it will increase airflow and help your tree breathe better. you can thin these areas by removing one out of every four branches or so. pruning tips & tricks where you cut matters when removing an entire branch, prune at a 45 - degree angle back to the branch collar, but not into it. basically, there shouldn ’ t be much of the branch left but you should never cut flush to the connecting branch or trunk. be sure to use clean, professional pruners for the best results. - do not prune young trees unless absolutely necessary. allow your tree to fully develop and grow into itself for 10 to 15 years before you do any serious pruning. - younger trees often get long, thin, whip - like branches. you may be tempted to prune off these scrawny long branches. however, it ’ s better if you don ’ t. be patient. they will fill out and get lateral branches. if you prune them off you are more likely to get even more of this same branch type. - don ’ t buy a japanese maple that grows too tall for the spot you have chosen. pruning japanese maples to control height is a fight you won ’ t win. it will only encourage faster growth and thinner, weaker branches. - do not prune off more than of the foliage or the crown of your japanese maple. - never over - prune. while aesthetic pruning of japanese maples is certainly an acceptable practice, we advise that you prune when necessary. believe it or not, sometimes less really is more. now you know how to prune japanese maples. just remember to be patient, take your time, and a little pruning maintenance can go a long way. plantingtree

Title: Carnations: Plant Care and Growing Guide
old container carnations that are root bound or need rejuvenating. knock off the old dirt from the roots and check for any rotted roots you can snip off with a sanitized cutting tool. repot the carnation into the container filled with good quality potting mix and water well but do not oversaturate or make the soil soggy. overwintering carnations are cold hardy and can easily survive tough winters. to ensure survival, cut the plants down to a few inches from the ground before winter hits. common pests & plant diseases carnations are vulnerable to pests, including aphids, spider mites, and cutworms. insecticidal soap can control aphids and spider mites. cutworms are a bit more complicated to eradicate, but you can try manually removing them or protecting your plants with collars. carnations are susceptible to fungal diseases, such as leaf spot, rust, and botrytis flower rot. the plant may also be the target of bacterial wilt ( symptoms include oozing ) and vascular wilt ( discoloration ). how to get carnations to bloom to enjoy a proliferation of ruffle - edged carnation blooms, it's best to plant them in a spot where they will receive at least six hours of sun a day. carnations prefer well - draining soil to bloom or they may flower, but they will look discolored. sometimes carnation buds are tight or not fully open. these two methods are easiest for cut carnations or carnations in a container. to open a resistant bloom, try brushing open the bud with the flower head of an older carnation, which provides just the right soft touch to motivate the resistant bloom to open. brush from the center of the flower to its outer edges to help it \\\" bloom. \\\" if the bud is closed but looks like it wants to open, gently squeeze the base of the bud to help loosen up any tightness, which can help give it a little push to bloom. common problems with carnations dianthus are fairly easy to grow and care for. but along the way you may spot some problems, including the following : brown blooms and / or leaves if parts of the flower are browning, but also papery to the touch, along with spots of gray fuzz, the plants are suffering from botrytis flower rot. rust and leaf spot could also cause browning and leaf curl. in any of these cases, remove the rotted parts and do not water plants from overhead to avoid getting the buds and leaves overly wet. space the plants to improve air circulation. yellowing leaves if leaves are becoming very light yellow, check for spider mites and their fine webs on the underside of the leaves. use insecticidal soap to control the issue. aphids could also cause the discoloration in the leaves. holes in buds it's likely cutworms have fed on the buds and created holes. going forward, plants will need protection or pesticides ( as a last option ). wilting and split stems bacterial wilt could have infected the plants, and younger plants are more vulnerable to the disease. remove diseased parts with a cutting tool that is well sterilized to avoid the spread of the problem. moving forward, be cautious when watering so you don't splash buds or leaves. root rot can also

light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.

Title: Diseases and pests on Douglas fir - waldwissen.net
( contarinia pseudotsugae ). the cooley spruce gall adelgid likes to suck on douglas fir needles in the young stand and thicket stage, causing the needles to become bent and / or discoloured and resulting in defoliation. this is particularly severe when combined with rhabdocline needle cast, as the trees cease to be competitive and then die. during this phase, they are also often attacked by small, native bark beetle species. the white wax - wool secretions of the cooley spruce gall adelgid are clearly visible. the western conifer seed bug was introduced in the late 1990s and has since proliferated and spread very rapidly. in addition to the douglas fir, it infests numerous other conifers and can also be found here on the cones of many foreign and domestic conifers, although no damage to seeds has been observed in switzerland to date. the douglas fir needle midge was first recorded in europe ( the netherlands, belgium, france, germany ) in 2015. the tiny, orange larvae feed on the inside of the needles, which subsequently deform, dry out and die. infestation is not usually fatal, but when combined with the aforementioned organisms it can further weaken young trees. site conditions and provenance are important factors that determine the susceptibility of the douglas fir to abiotic damage. unsuitable sites such as heavy, periodically wet soils with high clay, loam or lime content, as well as humid and cold locations, weaken the douglas fir considerably. the tree also does not cope well with flooding or waterlogging. the douglas fir is susceptible to root drying, which can cause problems, particularly after planting. regeneration from seeds or natural regeneration is therefore preferable to planting. natural regeneration is also advantageous given the root architecture. when planting, the method used is important. pit planting entails less consequential damage, especially from root rot, than notch planting using a mattock. winter and late frosts cause further damage. damage due to winter desiccation is frequently observed : direct solar radiation at temperatures above freezing causes the stomata to open early and triggers photosynthesis while the soil is still frozen. the subsequent weakening facilitates secondary damage by other organisms. the use of suitable provenances with a high frost tolerance increases the success of planting in the continental european climate. the douglas fir is better able to withstand drought. adult douglas firs show a lower susceptibility to prolonged summer droughts compared with spruce, beech, larch and scots pine. provenances from the western cascades ( oregon, usa ) and the coastal areas of oregon and washington seem to be suitable for continental european sites, both in the current and future climate. in the juvenile phase, however, the douglas fir is not very drought - tolerant as the root system first develops horizontally. the storm risk of douglas firs is a frequently discussed topic. albrecht et al. ( 2013 ) assess actual susceptibility to storm damage under current management practices as equal to that of spruce. his results correspond with those of lohmander & helles ( 1987 ), who, however, highlighted the limited data set on douglas fir. by contrast, other studies suggest that douglas fir withstands storm events better than spruce. decker ( 2018 ) compared the windthrow risk of spruce and douglas fir, with his results indicating that douglas fir is more resistant to storms than spruce up

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such

free of weeds. this is important when planting with seed or sod. perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. for perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules ( stems, rhizomes, and tubers ). it is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules will desiccate on the soil surface. rake off and remove the propagules. if you have particularly troublesome weed problems, continue to work the soil without irrigating for several months to bring up new propagules. a few species such as field bindweed and purple nutsedge cannot be controlled in this manner. a nonselective, systemic herbicide such as glyphosate, applied when weeds are actively growing, can also be used to kill many difficult - to - control perennials, but repeat applications may be needed. soil solarization can be very effective at controlling many weed species prior to planting and is ideal for gardeners who want to avoid herbicide use. once the area is rototilled, amended, and prepared for planting, place clear polyethylene plastic 1 to 2 mils ( 0. 025 - 0. 050 mm ) thick over the moist soil surface, and cover the edges with soil to hold them in place. for best results, soil solarization must be carried out during the time of highest solar radiation — from june to august in inland california — and the tarps must remain on the infested soil for 4 to 6 weeks. solarization is less effective or ineffective in cooler coastal areas or in the shade. many annual weeds can be controlled with this method ; however, soil solarization is not as effective at controlling certain perennials such as field bindweed and nutsedge. refer to pest notes : soil solarization for more information. many soils need to be amended with organic matter or nutrients. amendments can improve drainage in clay soils or improve the water - holding capacity in sandy soils. the ability of soils to drain water and simultaneously hold enough water is extremely important in establishing the turfgrass root system and maintaining healthy lawns. lawns thrive in soils with good drainage that allow the unrestricted flow of oxygen, nutrients, and water. when adding topsoil, make sure it is from a reputable source and that it is free of rocks, weed propagules such as rhizomes or tubers, and herbicide residues. select an appropriate turfgrass species turfgrass species vary in their tolerance to extreme temperatures, shade, drought, and amount of wear. they are divided into two broad categories : cool - season and warm - season grasses, which reflect their temperature preference and periods of active growth. cool - season species such as tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and kentucky bluegrass thrive at 60 - 80°f and may become stressed or go into a semi - dormant state in periods of extreme cold or hot temperatures. they do best in northern and coastal california climates, although there are cool - season grasses grown throughout california. warm - season grasses such as bermudagrass, buffalograss, kikuyugrass, st. augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass grow best in southern california or central valley climates where summers are hot and dry and winters are relatively mild. these grasses go dormant during winter months when soil temperatures drop below 52°f and then green up in spring when soil temperatures rise above 60°f.

Plant Identification Guides
Plant identification guides can aid biologists with proper identification of plant species in the field, such as when determining whether an area meets the criteria for classification as a wetland, or in assessing the floristic quality of a site for natural areas protection.
The Commission has also prepared lists of plants suitable for landscaping in Southeastern Wisconsin. Landscaping guides and invasive species eradication information can be found on the Zoning & Ordinances page.

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses : - leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib. - leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature. - growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses. - vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species. - inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns. - seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets. - stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature. - root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons. - habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates. to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities. identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a boat - shaped tip, and a prominent midrib on the upper side. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads through rhizomes, creating a dense, interconnected turf. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : pyramid - shaped panicle with branches that spread outward, containing small spikelets on delicate stalks. - color : deep green to bluish - green. bermudagrass ( cynodon dactylon ) - leaf blade : narrow, flat, and slightly rough on the upper side, with a pointed tip. - growth habit : spreads vigorously through both stolons and rhizomes. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a finger - like arrangement of spikes radiating from a central point, with each spike containing several spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. zoysiagrass ( zoysia spp. ) - leaf blade : narrow, stiff, and sharp, with a fine texture and a tapering tip. the upper side of the leaf blade is often hairy near the base. -

Title: Plant Identification Guides
Plant Identification Guides
Plant identification guides can aid biologists with proper identification of plant species in the field, such as when determining whether an area meets the criteria for classification as a wetland, or in assessing the floristic quality of a site for natural areas protection.
The Commission has also prepared lists of plants suitable for landscaping in Southeastern Wisconsin. Landscaping guides and invasive species eradication information can be found on the Zoning & Ordinances page.

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses : - leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib. - leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature. - growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses. - vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species. - inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns. - seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets. - stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature. - root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons. - habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates. to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities. identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a boat - shaped tip, and a prominent midrib on the upper side. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads through rhizomes, creating a dense, interconnected turf. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : pyramid - shaped panicle with branches that spread outward

Title: Diseases and pests on Douglas fir - waldwissen.net

native to northwest america, the douglas fir was introduced to europe in 1827, mainly because of its growth potential and the high quality of its timber. this conifer has gone on to become one of central europe's most important non - native tree species, with the coast douglas fir ( p. menziesii var. menziesii ) being the most common. this provenance is particularly suitable for central european forests. its high increment rates, ability to rapidly seal wounds and low number of associated diseases have contributed to its spread. all in all, this tree species is considered to be more productive, adaptable and resistant to damage than the spruce. however, even the douglas fir is not immune to diseases and pests. up to the thicket stage, it is even one of the tree species in europe most sensitive to disturbances. in particular, abiotic influences such as high humidity and waterlogging have a negative impact on these trees, while game, fungi and insects can also cause problems. by contrast, the douglas fir is mostly invulnerable to pests and diseases in the timber and mature timber stage. introduced tree species such as the douglas fir are very attractive to game and are therefore particularly at risk. douglas firs are most heavily damaged by thrashing. the males of the red deer ( cervus elaphus ), roe deer ( capreolus capreolus ) and sika deer ( cervus nippon ) remove the velvet from their newly formed antlers by thrashing them against douglas firs in the thicket stage, thus marking their territory and tearing the bark of the tree in the process. browsing of douglas firs mainly occurs in winter. the tree's popularity and the resulting loss of increment are somewhat lower than those of the silver fir. however, repeated browsing of the top shoots also results in permanent loss of quality. this is particularly significant in the case of planted trees, as these are individual investments. red and sika deer also damage douglas firs in the pole wood stage by stripping the bark off trees. the hazard is less serious than that faced by the spruce and the hazard period is also shorter because douglas fir bark brittles earlier. the loss of quality is low because the douglas fir is able to heal such wounds relatively well. damage is significant from the young stand to pole wood stage, especially in trees between 8 and 25 years old. the douglas fir is a popular tree for wild boars ( sus scrofa ) to rub against. trees heavily used in this way tend to fall down. the phenomenon occurs mainly in the vicinity of bait sites. the douglas fir is also of interest to smaller animals. the bank vole ( clethrionomys glareolus ), for instance, feeds on buds and shoots from late summer onwards. however, the damage typically only becomes noticeable in late autumn, when the bark on branch whorls is gnawed in places and stands out in particular due to its light colour. protective measures against game include individual mechanical protection mechanisms, such as mesh tree guards or fencing. the usual means to prevent stripping ( e. g. polynet or chemical protection using paint containing quartz sand ) do not sufficiently protect douglas firs. moreover, such measures are ineffective against thrashing. to protect the trunk against such damage, a two - metre - high wire mesh fence can be erected at some distance around the tree and fastened to a pole. fungi pose a major problem for douglas firs when it comes to forest protection, especially needle cast fungi ( such as swiss needle cast and rhabdocline needle cast ). swiss needle cast ( nothophaeocryptopus gaumannii, syn. phaeocryptopus gaumannii ) mainly causes significant damage in dense stands where humidity is high, with the damage being considerably greater in years with wet early summers. depending on the intensity of the infestation, needles are shed after one to three years and frost resistance is reduced. the combination of frost and fungal attack accelerates and exacerbates needle loss, resulting in substantial increment loss. however, even a severe infestation does not usually cause the tree to die. in contrast, secondary damage caused by the dark honey fungus ( armillaria ostoyae ) or insects such as the six - toothed spruce bark beetle ( pityogenes chalcographus ) or the fir bark beetle ( pityophthorus pityographus ) will occur in the case of major needle cast infestations lasting several years. trees can also be infested with the cooley spruce gall adelgid ( gilletteella cooleyi ) at the same time. rhabdocline needle cast ( rhabdocline pseudotsugae ) often leads to the death of the tree. compared with swiss needle cast, rhabdocline needle cast progresses much more quickly and intensively. however, our most common douglas fir variety ( pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii ) has proven to be highly resistant, whereas the varieties p. menziesii var. glauca and var. caesia are only suitable for cultivation in clearly continental climates due to their vulnerability to such infestations. dothistroma needle blight ( dothistroma sp. ) can also affect douglas firs. this fungal disease is mainly seen on pines and is considered a particularly dangerous organism. very serious outbreaks of this disease can jump to douglas firs from neighbouring pines. diseases affecting the shoots of the douglas fir can be caused by allantophomopsiella pseudotsugae ( syn. phacidium coniferarum, phomopsis pseudotsugae ), botrytis cinerea or sirococcus conigenus. a. pseudotsugae, which causes phomopsis disease in douglas firs, is probably the most concerning. it attacks the bark of twigs and trunks, causing it to die. this interrupts the supply to the higher parts of the tree, causing the needles of the affected branches to turn red and the top to die. the fungus occurs on the bark of various conifers, but only damages douglas fir and occasionally the japanese larch. young douglas firs weakened by frost, lack of water, plant shock, damage to bark, hail damage, severe needle cast or other stress factors are particularly at risk. the greatest outbreaks often occur in dense stands with high humidity, especially in years with wet early summers. the damage is considerably greater in these years. the fungus can be found on the bark of various conifers, but only damages douglas fir and occasionally the japanese larch. the fungus causes the needles of the affected branches to turn red and the top to die. the affected branches can die back completely. the fungus can also cause the needles of the affected

User > What’s the root cause of repeated rose chlorosis? I bought a grafted rose from a local nursery last Spring. It was planted on the south side of my house, in a flower bed, together with several other roses. I took care of this rose the same way I did with all other roses - water, organic fertilizer, fungicide and deadheading. Starting mid May, the leaves of this rose gradually grew tiny yellow specks. The specks would enlarge over time and spread from one side of a leaf to evenly all over the leaf. Eventually the entire leaves turned yellow and then drop. Due to this phenomenon, this rose bush lost all its leaves once, before new leaves sprouted. Soon, the cycle started again - the new leaves showed yellow specks and started falling. So far I did not see any sign of rust or insects on this rose. Nor does this chlorosis look like rose mosaic virus to my eyes. The roses surrounding this particular one are not affected by the same disease. I included a picture of the diseased leaves to show how the chlorosis develops over time. Could you help diagnose the problem?

Title: Rose: Identify and Manage Problems | University of Maryland Extension
The majority of plant problems are not caused by a disease or an insect, especially if the plant has been in your landscape for less than two years.
The presence of an insect or disease may not be the cause of the problem. Sometimes pests will take advantage of damaged or declining plants or the damage may have occurred way before you noticed it.
It is okay to tolerate some plant damage. For example, many fungal leaf spots cause cosmetic damage. Unsightly leaves can be simply pruned off the plant.
Poor growing conditions, incorrect care, weather extremes, and soggy soil are the major cause of plant decline.
Become familiar with normal plant characteristics throughout the year.
There are numerous parasitoids and predators that keep insect pests under control.
Use a pesticide only as a last resort and apply with care. First, identify the pest or disease and select low-toxicity products.

will need protection or pesticides ( as a last option ). wilting and split stems bacterial wilt could have infected the plants, and younger plants are more vulnerable to the disease. remove diseased parts with a cutting tool that is well sterilized to avoid the spread of the problem. moving forward, be cautious when watering so you don't splash buds or leaves. root rot can also cause wilting, leading to yellow leaves, and then imminent death. faq what does a carnation symbolize? the carnation, in general, symbolizes love and beauty. but different colors of carnations symbolize different things. for example, light red to someone you admire but dark red carnations to someone you love passionately. pink carnations indicate fondness, gratitude, and maternal love. purple carnations symbolize sorrow or apology. if you want to send a message of rejection or disappointment to someone, send yellow carnations. what is the carnation known for? carnations are one of the most popular commercial cut flowers for floral arrangements, corsages, and boutonnieres. considered an affordable alternative to roses, the flowers are known for their long - lasting fragrance and vase life. the pink carnation was designated in the early 1900s as the symbol for mother's day ( white carnations honor deceased mothers on mother's day ). are carnations lucky? carnations, especially white carnations, represent luck, as well as purity, which is why they are included in corsages and wedding bouquets. explore more : gardening plants & flowers flowers sources the spruce uses only high - quality sources, including peer - reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles. read our editorial process to learn more about how we fact - check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. carnation. aspca. carnation. aspca. newsletter sign up newsletter sign up by clicking “ accept all cookies ”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts. cookies settings accept all cookies

Title: Troubleshooting Philodendron Leaves Turning Yellow or Brown
’ water for best results. since the delicate foliage of philodendrons doesn't do well under the harmful rays of direct sun, it ’ s best to move your plant to a spot with bright, indirect light. to avoid overfeeding your philodendron, use half - strength balanced liquid fertilizer only in the growing season. if your plant has been living in the same soil for a long time, it's likely to get depleted of essential nutrients. the solution is repotting your philodendron in a fresh, nutrient - rich potting mix. why is my philodendron plant turning brown : causes and solutions in this section, we'll look at the common reasons behind your philodendron leaves turning brown, and the easy ways to prevent this. philodendron leaves turning brown : reasons brown spots on philodendron leaves are mostly a result of : - underwatering / overwatering - pests and bacterial diseases - nutritional deficiency - overexposure to sunlight - extreme temperature what to do when philodendron leaves turn brown? to fix brown leaves on a philodendron, adjust your watering routine. ensure the soil is well - draining and water only when the top layer of the soil feels dry. use a pot with drainage holes to prevent water accumulation around the root system. on that note, underwatering your plant can also lead to brown tips, so don ’ t leave it thirsty for prolonged periods. your philodendron will also benefit from medium to high humidity around it. thus, mist its leaves regularly, use a humidity tray, or turn on a humidifier nearby. additionally, keep your plant away from drafts and heating vents. protect your philodendron from hot temperatures and direct sunlight to prevent browning leaves. also, inspect the plant for pests or diseases and treat it with appropriate insecticides or fungicides. why are my philodendron leaves curled? your philodendron leaves may be curled for several reasons, including dry soil, low humidity, watering with heavily chlorinated tap water, and hot temperatures. curling leaves in plants is a natural defense mechanism against moisture loss. so, once you identify the exact reason, you can fix the issue more easily. how do you uncurl philodendron leaves? to uncurl your philodendron's leaves, ensure consistent watering ( especially during the hot summer days ), maintain high humidity around your plant through misting or using a humidifier, and provide bright, indirect light. checking for pests and ensuring a proper balance between soil water retention and drainage will also help promote healthy foliage in your plant. philodendron leaves drooping : reasons and solutions your philodendron may be drooping or wilting, due to inconsistent watering, low humidity, heat or cold - related stress, over - fertilization, transplant shock, and pests. low - light conditions can also cause your philo plant to droop. how do you fix a droopy philodendron? to address your droopy philodendron, check the soil moisture. since overwatering or underwatering can both cause drooping, ensure the soil is slightly moist but not waterlogged. improve drainage if needed. also, provide your green companion with bright, indirect light and maintain a consistent temperature without extreme fluctuations. finally, fertilize once during the growing season to encourage healthy growth and prevent overfeeding. other common philodendron issues some other common issues associated with this beautiful plant include : - philodendron leaves turning mushy : mushy leaves are mostly caused by overwatering or root rot. moderating your watering routine and inspecting your plant's roots for rot is recommended. you may need to repot your philodendron in fresh soil after cleaning the roots. - philodendron burnt leaves : exposure to direct sunlight is the primary cause of your philodendron's burnt leaves. to fix this, move your plant to a spot with bright but indirect sunlight. - philodendron pests and diseases : these plants often face pests like spider mites and aphids, and diseases like fungal root rot or bacterial leaf spot. reduce watering and improve drainage to minimize the risk of diseases. pests can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil and regular plant inspection. how do you revive a philodendron? follow these care tips to revive a dying philodendron : - trim any damaged leaves and stems. - place your plant near a sunny window, which receives bright but indirect sunlight. - keep the environment slightly humid. - feed your philodendron once or twice during the growing season. - regularly hydrate your plant to prevent it from drying. - repot your philo plant in fresh soil if you suspect root rot. - use a well - draining nutrient - rich soil mixed with a bit of perlite. philodendron leaf problems : faqs q : should i cut off brown philodendron leaves? a : yes! brown philodendron leaves are unlikely to become green again, so it would be sensible to cut them off. trim them just above the nodes to encourage the growth of new healthy leaves. q : what does an overwatered philodendron look like? a : symptoms of an overwatered philodendron include wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, mushy foliage and roots, and more. q : how do you know if your philodendron is underwatered? a : your philodendron is underwatered if its leaves turn yellow and brown from the tips. the foliage may also start to drop if your plant is thirsty. hydrate your plant thoroughly as soon as possible. q : how do i know if my philodendron has spider mites? a : if your philodendron has spider mites, you may notice fine ‘ webbing ’ on the leaves, discoloration on the foliage ( brown and yellow spots ), and a general decline in the plant ’ s health. q : how do you make a philodendron bushier? a : trim leggy philodendrons to promote bushier growth. overgrown vining varieties will also benefit from regular pruning. cut back your cascading plant if the vines have become too long. you can use some of the cutting to prop"

User > What are the removal strategies for jumping worms on my property? I've discovered jumping worms around the bases of some of the trees I have planted since Spring 2021. I wonder if I might have purchased some infested compost and spread the eggs/worms that way. Assuming we are discussing point locations and they've only had one year to go through their full life-cycle, what are my prospects for getting rid of them? I understand there are no chemical solutions at this time, and hand-picking seems to be the only viable strategy. Using mustard water as suggested by UMD extension and digging up the soil around four of my small trees, I removed over a hundred worms from about 10-20 square feet. I'm willing to keep removing them, but is there any reason to think this could reduce their population numbers to zero? It is difficult to find practical information on dealing with them.

EVIDENCE:
Title: Invasive Jumping Worms | University of Maryland Extension
“ jumping worms ” encompass three similar - looking non - native, invasive species. the worms thrash wildly and move in a snake - like manner ; their feeding produces granular castings that look like coffee grounds on the soil surface. they change soil composition, making it drier and depleted of nutrients, which limits normal plant germination and growth. the best way to manage jumping worms is by prevention ( e. g, make compost at home, inspect potted plants, buy bare - root plants ) and physical removal if they are detected. there are no chemical controls. what are invasive jumping worms? worms referred to as jumping worms, crazy worms, snake worms, jersey wigglers, georgia jumpers, and alabama jumpers include three similar - looking species : amynthas tokioensis, amynthas agrestis, and metaphire hilgendorfi, all of which are in the family megascolecidae. two or three species often occur in the same location. they are all non - native species, originating from asia. they have an annual life cycle ; the adults die after the first hard frost ; the next generation survives the winter in the form of cocoons ( egg casings ). they hatch and survive when the soil temperature is consistently about. they develop into full - size adults in about 60 days. climate change may be increasing the number of generations to two per year. they have “ boom ” and “ bust ” cycles from year to year. individual worms can reproduce without a mate ( parthenogenesis ) and their populations can increase quickly. they displace and out - compete other earthworms. they live only at the surface level of the soil and leaf litter ( epi - endogeic ) and therefore do not help gardeners with deep soil aeration, nutrient movement, or water infiltration. they can digest wood and favor areas with leaf mulch ; areas with pine needles and native grasses are less attractive to them ( source : university of wisconsin - madison ). where are jumping worms in maryland? jumping worms have been in the eastern united states for decades. amynthas agrestis was first recorded in 1939 in baltimore, maryland ( source : chang 2016 ). the extent of their current distribution in maryland is unknown. they are moved by way of human and animal activities - - most likely in the cocoon stage which is difficult to detect. they spread into new areas by way of mulches, compost, and potted plants ; in soil on tools, equipment, and shoes ; and in soil runoff. they like wet ( not saturated ) soil and get transported along streams and rivers. why are they a problem? invasive jumping worms consume large amounts of organic matter and change surface soil composition. they make the soil more gravelly in structure, drier, more prone to erosion, and less favorable to normal soil microorganisms ( fungi, bacteria ), and plant growth. the worm castings ( feces ) sit on top of the soil, leaving nutrients out of reach of plant roots and increasing the risk of nutrient runoff. any organism that relies on the normal composition of a natural forest floor for food and / or habitat will be disrupted by invasive jumping worms. this includes native plants, insects, birds, and other animals. a forest floor depleted of its normal mulch layer is less hospitable for seed germination and native plant establishment. in a home garden, soil disruption from jumping worms can diminish the growth of annuals, perennials, and turfgrass. how to prevent invasive jumping worms make your own compost and retain fallen leaves on your property to use for mulch / compost. if purchasing bulk compost and mulch, jumping worms and cocoons do not survive heat - treatment over 105f. however, even with heat treatment, jumping worms can infest compost piles or mulches if they are stored where jumping worms are present and the temperature is suitable for their survival. if you buy compost in bags, put the bags in the sun for several days to heat up. ( depending on the time of year / temperature, this may not be sufficient to heat to 105f. ) inspect plant pots for granular - looking soil before bringing plants home. purchase bare - root plants, if possible. propagate plants from seeds and cuttings. be careful about bringing soil onto your property on tools, shoes, and plants ; require landscape contractors to use clean equipment. do not purchase invasive jumping worms for bait or vermicomposting. do not dispose of unused bait on the ground or in or near the water. how to determine if you have invasive jumping worms? the presence of distinctive granular soil that looks like spent coffee grounds or ground meat may be your first indicator of jumping worms. this granular material is mostly worm castings. worms present in leaf litter and mulch or very near the soil surface range from about 1. 5 to 8 inches in length ( varies by species and maturity ). they are easier to identify from june through late summer when they are mature. they thrash wildly when handled. their movement is snake - like. they sometimes drop a few segments of their tail when aggravated. they are smooth, gray / brown / purple, have a rigid texture, dark pigmentation on the top side, lighter on the bottom. they are iridescent when fully mature. adult jumping worms have a cream - colored band ( clitellum ) that completely encircles the body. the clitellum lies flat against the body for most of the adult stage, except during egg production when it swells. the clitellum is relatively close to the head, at segments 14 - 16. ( source : chang, 2016 ). in contrast, on european earthworms, the clitellum is saddle - shaped and does not wrap around the entire body. cocoons are 1 - 3 millimeters in diameter and resemble a particle of soil. mustard test : using a liquid “ mustard pour ” is a way to test for jumping worms. mix ⅓ cup of ground hot yellow mustard seed ( look for chinese or asian hot mustard ) into 1 gallon of water and pour half of the liquid slowly over a 1 square foot of soil you want to test. wait a few minutes and pour the rest. this will make worms ( any earthworms ) come to the surface. identify, collect, and discard jumping worms, if present. the mustard solution will not harm plants or kill the worms. what to do if you find invasive jumping worms? there are currently no chemical control methods for invasive jumping worms. physical removal methods : - hand - pick worms, seal them in a trash bag and discard the bag in your trash. - worms also can be killed by putting them into a container with vinegar or rubbing alcohol. dead worms can be composted. - spread bulk mulch / compost / soil on a driveway to expose worms to predators and hand - picking. this will not kill any cocoons that are present. - solarization : jumping worm adults and cocoons will not survive over 105f. one method to kill them is to make a “ solarization package. ” lay down a sheet of clear plastic ( e. g., painter ’ s drop cloth ) in a sunny area, 10 - 15 feet in length, place compost, mulch, or soil on top of the plastic, no deeper than 6 - 8 inches, and then wrap the plastic over top and around to encase the material completely in a plastic package. on a sunny summer day, research has shown a solarization package can heat to over 150f. ( gorres, university of vermont ). however, the temperature will vary by time of year and local conditions. research on the amount of time it takes to kill cocoons has varied and may take up to three days. - solarization of garden soil is more difficult because the killing temperature of 105f cannot be maintained. worms under the plastic will move to a different location. for plant exchanges and sales : do not share plants in potted soil from your garden if you know you have jumping worms. when the presence of jumping worms / cocoons is unknown, as a precautionary measure, plants can be bare - rooted and potted into sterile potting medium prior to exchanges or sales. the university of new hampshire extension explains these procedures. educate others about jumping worms and good practices to prevent their spread. - research is underway to explore the use of various products and methods ( e. g., fungi, saponins, sulfur, fire, biochar ) to control invasive jumping worms. - some native plant species have shown more tolerance to jumping worm invaded areas than others : christmas fern, jack - in - the - pulpit, and trout lily. the maryland department of agriculture and the maryland department of natural resources are not currently regulating invasive jumping worms. you can report invasive jumping worms and submit your photos on the early detection and distribution mapping system, https : / / www. eddmaps. org /. additional resources asian jumping worms : a homeowner's guide | cornell university jworm working group, 2021 asian jumping worms : a threat to gardens and woodlands ( has good close - up photos ) | ohio state university, 2020 invasive jumping worms frequently asked questions | university of massachusetts | amherst jumping worms : identification | university of massachusetts amherst plant sales and jumping worms | university of new hampshire cooperative extension the visible invisible : impacts of invasive jumping worms | maryland invasive species council, 2019\", "

Title: Garden Pests: Tiny Transparent Worms
A tiny, transparent worm in your garden may be a friend or a foe. Identifying the creature is a challenge, but worth the effort. You don't want to wipe out an ally just because it's squirmy or ignore plant damage that could be prevented or mended solely because the cause is almost too small to see.

Probable Garden Worm Identification
If the worms in your garden are truly tiny, really colorless, and actual worms, they are most likely nematodes. Nematodes in gardens and landscape plants may be so small that they're only visible with a microscope, or they can be up to several inches long. Most are invisible to the naked eye. They are transparent or colorless — not white. Nematodes have no legs at all. Many pests called worms are actually caterpillars and have legs, but nematodes are limbless, unsegmented roundworms.

Beneficial Free-Living Nematodes
Free-living nematodes feed on bacteria and fungi, while other nematodes and protozoa are omnivores. These serve important functions in the complex world of healthy soil and are beneficial members of the microorganism population of your garden. They can help control certain plant diseases and insect pests and make nutrients more available to your plants.

Plant-Parasitic Nematodes, the Bad Guys
Parasitic nematodes are parasites, meaning they rely on another living organism to sustain them through their life cycles. There are species that infect humans and even nematodes several yards long that parasitize whales. But in your garden, you're likely to have tiny (about 1/50 inch) plant-parasitic nematodes, who are definitely bad guys.

The most common is the root-knot nematode, of which there are several varieties, which damage the delicate root systems of vegetables and perennials, causing stunted growth and possibly plant death. Infected plants are yellowed, wilted, and/or stunted. Pull them up and you'll see lumpy nodules on the roots that contain the nematodes and prevent your plants from taking in the nutrients they need. There are also foliar nematodes that damage leaves and stems.

Insect-Parasitic Nematodes, the Good Guys
Some nematodes attack insects instead of plants. These can be allies, as they sterilize, debilitate, or kill their hosts. You can purchase these beneficial nematodes at garden centers and through catalogs and safely disperse them in your garden and landscaping, because they are not a threat to plants or animals, but only their specific insect hosts. They can help control borers, caterpillars, grubs, weevils, and root worms.

Nematode Damage Control
While insect-parasitic nematodes may be doing some kinds of damage in your garden, you will want to minimize the damage done by plant-parasitic varieties. This can be difficult. First, ask your local extension service if they can help you definitively identify damaging nematodes in your soil. They'll tell you if they are able to test for nematodes and instruct you on how to bring in a sample for testing. Pull up and destroy infested plants to prevent further spreading of the bad nematodes. And consider solarizing your soil and letting it lie fallow for a year. This will kill most of the nematodes and starve out the survivors.

Title: Insect Problems in the Vegetable Garden: Chewing Insects
(News article for May 14, 2022; edited)
As discussed last week, insect and mite pest problems can often be prevented or reduced by using good cultural practices. However, insecticides are sometimes needed to avoid significant losses.
Since pest issues are easier to manage when the insects are smaller and fewer in number, it’s important to observe plants often. Before using an insecticide, it’s important to correctly identify the insect or mite causing the problem. Different insecticides are effective on different pests.
This week, I’m writing about “chewers,” or insects that make holes of various sizes in various plant parts.
Caterpillars, which are the larvae of moths and butterflies, can cause highly visible damage on plants. Some examples of caterpillar insect pests are hornworms (often found on tomato), corn earworm AKA tomato fruitworm, cabbage loopers, cutworms, and squash vine borers.
While caterpillars cause some of the most noticeable damage to plants, there are a number of insecticide options for managing them. Products with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) as the active ingredient target caterpillars, specifically, and are some of the insecticides least likely to harm bees and other beneficial insects. Proteins in Btk products become toxic to caterpillars after they get into the insects’ digestive tract.
Insecticides containing spinosad have efficacy against caterpillar pests and, while they’re not as selective for caterpillars as Btk products are, they pose less risk to beneficial insects than some other insecticides. However, they are toxic to bees prior to drying. The threat to bees can be reduced by spraying at times when bees are not likely to be active, such as the late afternoon or evening.
Other active ingredients with efficacy against caterpillars include carbaryl and the pyrethroids (active ingredients ending in "-thrin,") plus esfenvalerate. These are broad-spectrum insecticides that pose more risk to beneficial insects, so it’s better to avoid using them when alternatives are available. To minimize the threat to bees, avoid spraying plants (including weeds around vegetable plants) while they’re flowering if possible, and spray at times when bees aren’t active.
Besides caterpillars, beetle pests also have chewing mouthparts and make holes of various sizes in plants. Pests in the beetle order include flea beetles, Colorado potato beetles, cucumber beetles, bean leaf beetles, and weevils, including cowpea curculio. There are fewer effective options for beetles than for caterpillars. The pyrethroid insecticides, carbaryl, and malathion generally have efficacy against beetles. Spinosad is effective against Colorado potato beetle, specifically.
Before using an insecticide, be sure to make sure that it’s labeled for use on the vegetable(s) on which you plan to use it. Read and follow all label instructions.
For information about insects with sucking mouthparts (including aphids, whiteflies, stink bugs, and others), see the next article.

Oak leaf gall mites are more of a problem for humans than for oak trees. These insects live inside the galls on oak leaves. If they leave the galls in search of other food, they can be a true nuisance. Their bites are itchy and painful. So exactly what are oak leaf mites? What is effective in treating oak mites? If you want more information on how to get rid of oak mites, also called oak leaf itch mites, read on.

What are Oak Leaf Mites?

Oak tree gall mites are tiny parasites that attack gall larvae on oak leaves. When we say tiny, we mean tiny! You may not be able to spot one of these mites without a magnifying glass. The female and male oak tree gall mites mate. Once the females are fertilized, they enter the gall and paralyze the larvae with their venom. The female mites then feed on the larvae until their offspring emerge. An entire generation of oak mites can emerge in a single week, which means that the mite population can swell rapidly. Once the oak tree gall mites have eaten the gall larvae, they leave in search of other food. Even if they don’t run out of food, mites may leave the galls. They may fall from the tree or be blown off by a breeze. This usually happens late in the season when the mite population is very large. Some 300,000 mites can fall from each tree every day.

Oak tree gall mites can enter a house through open windows or screens and bite people inside. More often, however, the mites bite people while working outdoors in the garden. The bites usually occur on the upper body or wherever clothing is loose. They are painful and itch a lot. People who are not aware of oak tree gall mites think they have been bitten by bed bugs. You might think that spraying the oak tree would be an effective oak mite control, but this is not the case. The oak tree gall mites actually live inside the galls. Since tree sprays do not penetrate the galls, the mites are safe from sprays. If you are wondering how to get rid of oak mites, there is no perfect solution. You can try to exercise oak mite control by using DEET, a commercially available mosquito and tick repellent. In the end though, you can only protect yourself best by being vigilant. Stay away from oak trees with galls toward the end of summer. When you do go into the garden or near the trees, shower and wash your clothes in hot water when you come in from gardening.

Title: Buck Moth Caterpillar Defoliates Oak Trees | Davey Tree

Buck Moth Caterpillar Description:

The buck moth caterpillar is a serious pest that defoliates oaks, particularly in the southeastern United States. The moths have dark gray wings with an irregular, median white band and a crescent-shaped, white mark bordered in black on each wing.

Caterpillars eat the leaves of oak trees, (primarily live oaks, but also water oaks). They are found from Maine to Georgia and west to Texas. The caterpillars destroy a tree’s natural beauty and vigor, making it more susceptible to diseases and insect attacks.

Moths emerge from the soil in late fall, post-leaf drop. Each female deposits 70-200 whitish-tan eggs in a cluster encircling the oak twigs. Larvae hatch over a prolonged period starting in early spring and caterpillars can appear before the leaves emerge. By mid-spring, the larvae have undergone 5 growth stages, growing from 1/8” larvae to 2 ½” caterpillars. Caterpillar spines often cause dermal irritation. Young buck moth caterpillars will organize themselves into communities and will even follow each other in a single file. They are often seen migrating across lawns or climbing the sides of buildings in search of places to pupate in the fall. Moths normally appear at the start of deer hunting season, thus the name, buck moth.

Buck Moth Caterpillar Control & Management:

There are several control options, including such biorationals as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) and horticultural oil. Affected trees should also be fertilized with Arbor Green PRO® to improve their recovery and overall vigor.

a wasp parasite, cotesia congregata. parasitized hornworms are easily recognized by the small, white, oblong cocoons attached to their backs ( figure 22b and figure 22c ). leave these worms in the garden so the emerging wasps can parasitize other hornworms. for chemical recommendations, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. silverleaf whitefly, bemisia argentifolii bellows and perring, aleyrodidae, homoptera adult — the silverleaf whitefly ( figure 23a ) is slightly smaller and slightly yellower than other whiteflies. the female is almost 1 / 16 inch long, and the male is somewhat smaller ( figure 24 ). the wings are held rooflike at about a 45 - degree angle, whereas other whiteflies usually hold their wings nearly flat over the body. hence, the silverleaf whitefly appears more slender than other common whiteflies. egg — the eggs are whitish to light beige with the apex tending to be slightly darker. the eggs are inserted on end into the undersides of new leaves ( figure 23b ). nymph — the nymphal stage appears glassy to opaque yellowish and may or may not have dorsal spines, depending on leaf characteristics. the body is flattened and scalelike, with the margins relatively near the leaf surface ( figure 23c and figure 23d ). pupa — the pupa or fourth nymphal instar is somewhat darker beige - yellow and opaque. pupae are plumper than previous nymphal stages ( figure 24 ). some of the spiracular furrows have a small amount of white wax deposits. the caudal setae are prominent, and the caudal end is somewhat acute. dorsal spines are present when the host leaf is hairy and absent when the host leaf is smooth. the outer edges of the body are rounded. distribution — the silverleaf whitefly occurs around the world in tropical and subtropical areas and in greenhouses in temperate areas. host plants — the number of host plants is extensive. the plant families most often reported as hosts are amaranthaceae, compositae, convolvulaceae, cruciferae, cucurbitaceae, euphorbiaceae, labiatae, leguminosae, malvaceae, moraceae, rosaceae, solanaceae, and verbenaceae. in addition to tomato, the most frequently reported hosts in the southeastern united states are poinsettia and gerbera daisy. damage — adults and nymphs cause direct damage by removing sap. chlorotic spots sometimes appear at the feeding sites on leaves, and heavy infestations cause leaf wilting. the excretion of honeydew and the subsequent development of sooty mold fungi also may reduce photosynthesis and other physiological functions of the plant. even though the silverleaf whitefly is considered an economic pest, little information is known about the damage it causes or the economic thresholds in tomatoes. life history — developmental times from egg deposition to adult emergence vary from 16 to 38 days and appear to be primarily influenced by temperature, humidity, and the host plant. the number of eggs laid by each female over her lifetime varies considerably, but is usually about 90. reports from israel indicate that repeated applications of insecticides have produced a resistant, highly fecund strain of silverleaf whitefly, with the females capable of

, clover, vetch, and plantain. damage — like serpentine leafminers, vegetable leafminers create light - colored, irregularly winding mines in leaves. the mines are generally s - shaped and may be enlarged at one end ( figure 28e ). infested leaves are favorable habitats for bacterial and fungal plant pathogens. also, because heavily mined leaves may have much of their mesophyll ( internal tissue ) removed, photosynthetic efficiency is greatly reduced ( figure 29 ). severe infestations may cause the foliage to turn brown and appear burned. damaging infestations are most likely to occur after crops have been treated weekly with insecticides such as methomyl or carbaryl. these pesticides kill parasitic wasps that usually keep the leafminer populations at acceptable levels. life history — vegetable leafminers feed and breed year - round in the southern areas of florida and texas. in north carolina, they overwinter in soil as pupae. generally, adult flies that emerge in april or may live only four to ten days. after mating, females insert eggs into leaf tissue from the underside of the leaf. eggs hatch three to eight days later, and young larvae begin feeding, each one creating its own mine. although the leaf - mining stage may last up to twelve days, it is usually completed in four to five days during summer. larvae pupate for about 10 days ( longer in spring and fall ) at the enlarged ends of the mines or in soil. a new generation is produced about every 23 days. at least five generations occur each year in southern states. the number is higher in the tropics and in greenhouses. on a small scale, it is practical to remove infested tomato leaves to help keep leafminer populations in check. economically significant leafminer damage rarely occurs on tomatoes. for large - scale producers, insecticides remain the most reliable method of controlling infestations. for recommended insecticides and rates, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. western flower thrips frankliniella occidentalis ( pergande ), thripidae, thysanoptera adult — the western flower thrips ( figure 30a ) is almost 1 / 16 inch long, with the female larger than the male. the female varies from yellow to dark - brown and has a plump abdomen. the male is always pale yellow and has a narrower abdomen. egg — yellowish eggs cannot be seen easily because they are inserted into the plant tissue ( figure 30b ). larva — the larvae develop through two instars and are distinctly yellow. first instars ( figure 30c ) are noticeably smaller than second instars. second instars ( figure 30d ) are about the same size as adult females, and they become whitish before molting. prepupa and pupa — both prepupa ( figure 30e ) and pupa ( figure 30f ) are quiescent, nonfeeding stages. they are yellowish. antennae of prepupae protrude forward, whereas antennae of pupae are folded back over the head. prepupae have noticeable wing pads on the thorax. wing pads of pupae extend back along the abdomen. distribution — before 1980, the distribution was thought to be limited to west of the mississippi river. however, the western flower thrips has become the most prevalent thrips species attacking greenhouse plants throughout the united states

spp., polydrusus spp. ) sometimes feed on young douglas fir needles. feeding on the shoots causes damage similar to that of late frost due to the brown colouring of the youngest needle class and is sometimes conspicuous, but is usually minor. noticeable increment loss mostly occurs in forest nurseries. the pine processionary moth ( thaumetopoea pityocampa ) can infest douglas firs as well as pines. it is found on the southern side of the alps as well as in valais and the lake geneva area. from the pole wood stage onwards, the distinct, fist - sized hibernation nests of the caterpillars can then be observed in the tree crowns. however, feeding in the crowns is mostly insignificant and damage is usually negligible ; to date, major feeding damage has only been observed on younger pines or in monocultures. the pine processionary moth could become a serious danger to the douglas fir, however, should the caterpillars'preference for douglas fir needles observed in the laboratory replicate itself in the field. bark beetles are also found on douglas firs. the fir bark beetle ( pityophthorus pityographus ) is by far the most common insect to nest in pre - weakened young douglas firs, causing them to die. the star - shaped breeding gallery of this small bark beetle species is recognisable by the way the mating chambers clearly sink into the sapwood. the fir bark beetle occasionally also appears with the six - toothed spruce bark beetle ( pityogenes chalcographus ). sometimes both species are seen on the same douglas fir. other native softwood bark beetles can also be found on douglas fir from time to time, mainly in horizontal infestations. in switzerland, the larger eight - toothed european spruce bark beetle ( ips typographus ), the large larch bark beetle ( ips cembrae ), the grained spruce bark beetle ( cryphalus abietis ), the striped ambrosia beetle ( xyloterus lineatus ) and the black timber bark beetle ( xylosandrus germanus ), which has become naturalised from east asia, have already been found on douglas firs. in addition, several other native forest insects, mainly butterflies and beetles, have taken douglas fir as their host tree in europe. so far, however, there have been no reports of damage in switzerland in this respect. some insect species migrated with their host tree in the 19th century and have become established here. the douglas fir seed chalcid ( megastigmus spermotrophus ) is one example. unlike in america, however, the chalcid does not cause significant seed loss here. as in north america, the chalcid is only found in the douglas fir. other newcomers are the cooley spruce gall adelgid ( gilletteella cooleyi ), the western conifer seed bug ( leptoglossus occidentalis ) and the douglas fir needle midge ( contarinia pseudotsugae ). the cooley spruce gall adelgid likes to suck on douglas fir needles in the young stand and thicket stage, causing the needles to become bent and / or discoloured and resulting in defoliation. this is particularly severe when combined with rhabdocline needle cast, as the trees cease to be competitive and then die."

Title: Apple Tree Pests: Identification and Treatment — Raintree Nursery
intervention are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. they tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. this feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. one of the most noticeable signs of an aphid infestation is apple tree leaves turning yellow, which indicates that the tree is under stress from the loss of nutrients. left unchecked, aphids can weaken your apple tree, making it more susceptible to other diseases and pests. regular monitoring and natural control methods can help prevent serious damage. apple - leaf blister mites apple - leaf blister mites are tiny pests that cause noticeable red or yellow blisters on the leaves of your apple tree. while the damage is mostly cosmetic, a severe infestation can weaken the tree over time. this weakening can result in reduced fruit production as the tree's energy is diverted toward recovering from the mite damage. apple - leaf blister mites are particularly problematic in young trees or in cases where the infestation goes untreated. regular inspection of leaves for blistering can help catch the problem early, ensuring that your tree stays healthy and productive. speckled green fruitworm speckled green fruitworms are caterpillars that feed on apple tree leaves and fruit. if you notice chunks missing from your apples, you may have these critters on your hands. how to keep apple tree pests at bay keeping apple tree pests at bay is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tree. prevention is always easier than dealing with a full - blown infestation. here are some effective natural strategies to protect your apple trees : - prune regularly : remove damaged or dead branches where pests may hide or lay eggs. this keeps your tree healthy and makes it harder for pests to establish themselves. - encourage beneficial insects : ladybugs and lacewings prey on harmful pests like aphids. introducing or attracting these beneficial insects to your garden can naturally control pest populations. - use organic treatments : spray neem oil or horticultural soap on your tree to suffocate and repel pests. these organic solutions are effective without harming beneficial insects or the environment. - net your apple trees : netting is an excellent organic method to prevent pests, such as apple maggot flies, from laying eggs on your apples. it is a simple but highly effective way to safeguard your fruit. - keep the area clean : clear away fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris around the tree. this prevents pests from using the ground as a breeding site and helps reduce the chances of reinfestation. these methods will help keep your apple tree healthy and free from common pests. organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees? when it comes to pest control for your apple trees, there are two primary options : organic and chemical. our findings show that while chemical treatments can be highly effective at quickly eliminating pests, they come with drawbacks, such as potentially harming beneficial insects and negatively impacting the environment. organic methods, such as using neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introducing natural predators, offer a safer, more environmentally sustainable approach. these methods work well for most situations, though they may require more frequent application. in cases of severe infestations, chemical treatments may be necessary to prevent significant damage to your trees. ultimately, it's about finding the right balance between protecting your apple trees and aligning with your gardening values. dealing with apple tree pests can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies in place, your apple trees will remain healthy and productive for years to come. from tackling apple tree rust treatment to addressing orange spots on apple tree leaves, knowing how to manage pests is crucial for a thriving harvest. if you're looking for the best disease resistant apple trees or more tips on how to keep bugs off apple trees naturally, raintree nursery has a wide selection of varieties and expert resources to guide you. as trusted experts in home gardening, we're committed to helping you grow the healthiest, most productive apple trees possible. visit raintree nursery today to explore our options and get started on your journey to successful apple growing! if you want to learn more, why not check out this article below : - will apples ripen off the tree - pruning apple trees - how long does it take for an apple tree to grow?

A typical day in the garden can be ruined by the appearance of a stray insect that leads you to the discovery of an infestation, or worse, a few discolored, curled leaves and the dawning realization that your raspberry plants have contracted raspberry leaf curl virus. Unfortunately, leaf curl disease is much more than a cosmetic problem -- the curled leaves on raspberries are an early clue that your plants have a deadly disease.
Raspberry Leaf Curl Virus
Raspberry leaves curling is just one sign of raspberry leaf curl virus, an incurable disease vectored by the small raspberry aphid (Aphis rubicola). Leaves will change, sometimes dramatically, during the early stages of infection. Often, they arch stiffly or curl downward and change colors; red raspberries usually develop yellow leaves, while black raspberries turn very dark green, with a greasy appearance. As the disease progresses, the canes may also stiffen and become brittle, and fruits mature small, seedy, and crumbly, making them inedible. A mild infection may go unnoticed for the first season, but a severe case of leaf curl disease visibly reduces yields and decreases the winter tolerance of your plant. You may find your canes die back considerably more than usual while they're dormant. Raspberry leaf curl virus can kill a raspberry stand in two to three years and cannot be cured.
How to Prevent Raspberry Leaf Curl
If there are already curled leaves on raspberries in your garden, and other signs of leaf curl disease are emerging, you need to remove and burn or double bag infected plants as soon as possible. There is no cure or treatment for this disease and by removing infected plants, you may save clean plants nearby. Before replanting your raspberry stand, remove any wild caneberries nearby, as well as neglected brambles. Purchase certified, virus-free nursery stock from a reputable supplier when you're ready to plant again. Make sure that you clean your tools well before removing the new raspberries from their pots, to prevent transmission of the virus from infected plants to your clean stock via shovels and pruners. Sticky cards help you monitor for aphid activity once your raspberries are planted. These pests are easily sprayed from leaves with a garden hose, or you can spray weekly with insecticidal soap to knock down any aphids on the plant, visible or not. Harsher pesticides are sometimes used, but these will destroy the beneficial insects that may be your best defense against aphid activity. If your plants are very valuable or you're raising just a few bushes, you may want to consider installing a screen house around your plantings. Using a screen with a very fine mesh will prevent new aphids from entering the area and keep commercially available aphid predators, like lacewings or ladybugs, close to your crop. If you decide to use beneficial insects, make sure they have an alternative food source and water supply."

when it comes to maple trees, the foliage gets all the attention … and why wouldn ’ t it? in addition to having an iconic shape and providing bountiful shade from the sun, acer leaves reveal beautiful shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. a maple ’ s foliage is arguably its best feature. but the bark of a maple plays an ornamental supporting role to the leaves, taking center stage once the defoliated trees go dormant. we link to vendors to help you find relevant products. if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. with smooth bark that roughens and fissures to create interesting textures with age, acer bark is a gorgeous part of the tree that is often overlooked. unfortunately, this beautiful bark isn ’ t immune to harm. whether it ’ s due to a disease, environmental condition, or just faulty cultivation, there are some afflictions that can really take a toll on your trees. in this guide to identifying and treating maple bark diseases, we ’ ll cover the main threats you should keep an eye out for, how to treat these issues when they come up, and even how to prevent them from occurring in the first place. here ’ s a quick peek at the potential bark issues that we ’ ll cover up ahead : 9 common maple bark afflictions 1. burr knots and galls both burr knots and galls look like strange, sickly - looking lumps on tree trunks or branches … but there ’ s a bit more to them than that. burr knots actually form from small adventitious roots or bud tissues that don ’ t quite form shoots, and tend to grow in warm, humid conditions. they grow larger and more knotted as the tree matures. although they may look less than attractive on the tree, burr knots are actually prized by woodworkers for the unique swirls and patterns that they contain. galls, on the other hand, could be more accurately described as tumors, since they ’ re usually caused by bacteria or infectious material left behind by pests. the infectious agent spurs the gall to grow uncontrollably, and a gall can range in size from a half - inch to more than a foot in diameter. burr knots can easily break in frosty or windy conditions, provide easy access points for pests and pathogens, and even limit the flow of nutrients through the phloem if they manage to grow together in a mass of multiple knots. galls also block nutrients from flowing throughout the plant, in addition to looking even more contorted and irregular than burr knots. both burr knots and galls leave plant growth compromised as they block the healthy movement of nutrients. this tends to manifest as stunted growth or overall decline. to prevent burr knots, it ’ s imperative to keep the trunk dry. avoid growing vegetation under the canopy, or wrapping your trunk in a tree guard of any kind. skipping the former will prevent adjacent evapotranspiration from moistening your tree, while the latter will allow your tree to remain aired out and dry. if it ’ s too late for preventive care, feel free to cut out burr knots, as long as there are only a few of them. hey, maybe you ’ ll end up with some cool lumber to use in woodworking! galls are best prevented by avoiding injury to your trees and managing pests. you can cut them out if they ’ re already present on your maple, but if the tree is too far gone you ’ ll have to dig the plant out. make sure to burn the roots and stump to prevent further infection. for the treatment of both burr knots and galls, gallex is a flowable emulsion of 2, 4 - xylenol and meta - cresol that ’ s only available commercially … but you can hire a professional arborist who ’ s qualified to apply this product onto the infected areas of your tree. gallex targets the unhealthy tissues while leaving the healthy parts of the plant alone. although maybe not as pressing as the canker sores that might sprout in your mouth, cankers on a maple tree are definitely cause for concern. when an open wound becomes infected by a fungal or bacterial pathogen, a canker often results. cankers tend to have a sunken, irregularly - shaped, brown - to - reddish appearance to them. with varied shapes and sizes, these lesions can show up on branches, trunks, or anywhere that bark appears on the tree. they can also ooze sap and moisture, along with giving off a foul scent. other than the physical blemishes of the lesions, cankers can cause numerous problems in the foliage such as stunted growth, chlorosis, browning, and curling. as a canker worsens and spreads, the causal pathogen can end up clogging the vascular system of a tree, leading to wilt and branch dieback. stresses such as environmental extremes, structural injuries, and improper cultivation can all promote conditions favorable to the development of cankers. fungal cankers contain fruiting bodies, which produce spores that can spread to form new cankers elsewhere, especially in wet or moist conditions. preventing cankers and preventing stress go hand in hand – since stressful conditions are often a precursor for canker development, it ’ s essential to cultivate your maples properly in places where they ’ re well - adapted. avoid unnecessarily wounding an acer, and make sure to frequently sanitize any gardening tools that you use with sprays or soaks in a 70 to 100 percent rubbing alcohol solution. a 99 percent isopropyl alcohol solution is available in 16 - ounce bottles on amazon. cankers on twigs and branches can be snipped off several inches behind the afflicted segment of the shoot. make clean pruning cuts above the branch collar, making sure to avoid leaving a stub. only prune in dry conditions with sterilized tools. it ’ s important to leave trunk canker removal to the professionals, i. e. certified arborists and professional plant pathologists. when you slice into these cankers willy - nilly, you could kick - start the spread of fungi – the botanical equivalent of cutting off a hydra ’ s head. in pop culture, comic book villains such as captain cold, mr. freeze, and killer frost wield the cold with nefarious intentions … and while there aren ’ t any evildoers walking around the real world causing trouble, maple trees can be a victim of cold damage. sunscald is a common issue that can occur on maple trunks, especially on young trees that don ’ t have a thick enough bark layer to protect themselves from the harsh rays of the sun. early symptoms include reddish - brown, canker - esque discoloration and slight vertical cracks in the bark. damaged areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic tree guards. these covers will need to be left in place until the bark on the trunk has matured sufficiently or until the tree ’ s canopy is large enough to provide ample shade – both of which could take several years. other than cutting away exfoliated bark, there ’ s not much you can do for trees that have already been damaged by sunscald. proper care for an injured tree involves the same practices and methods that you would use for a perfectly healthy specimen, and you can read more about these in our guide to growing maples. hundred - foot rolls of brown kraft paper made from 100 percent recycled material are available via amazon. 9. trunk suffocation mulch can be very beneficial, don ’ t get me wrong – but only in goldilocks amounts. if your maple looks like it ’ s growing out of a volcano made of mulch, then you ’ ve piled it on a bit too thick and placed it too close to the trunk. too much mulch that ’ s piled on essentially suffocates the lower trunk, which leads to the death of inner bark tissue, which limits nutrient transport through the phloem. this weakens roots, leaving them malnourished and unable to take up resources for the tree, which leads to aboveground plant problems. a massive mound of mulch around the trunk also creates a moist entry point for pathogens and pests to infiltrate the now - decaying inner bark tissue. plus, it can easily overheat, which can prevent necessary cold - hardening come wintertime … or it may straight - up cook the inner bark of the tree in the summer, killing it in the process. to mulch properly, apply two to four inches – less for fine - textured materials, more for coarse textures – in mid - spring, spread in a three - to five - foot radius out from the trunk. make sure to keep the mulch two inches away from the trunk and root flares. maple bark disease : beat it with ease when it comes to plant care, learning about diseases and other health issues not caused by infectious pathogens is half of the battle. when you know what causes a disease or affliction, preventing it is simple. when you find out what cures an illness, fixing the problem is that much easier. maple bark may take second fiddle to the foliage, but it ’ s still an important part of the symphony, aesthetics - wise. now that you ’ re able to keep it healthy, you can rest easy, knowing that your maple tree ’ s full glory is within reach, and your plant is firing on all cylinders. any questions, remarks, or insightful in - the - trenches experiences can go into the comments section below. and if you ’ re now jonesing for some more maple guides, get your fix with these articles next : "

Title: Lawns: Dead Patches and Fixes | RHS Advice
regular lawn care will help to keep your grass strong and resilient drought is a common cause of brown patches in summer several fungal diseases can weaken or kill grass dog urine can damage patches of lawn over application or incorrect use of fertilisers and weedkillers can damage or kill turf what causes dead patches? there are many potential reasons why bare patches may appear, from physical damage to fungal diseases and drought. it can be tricky to diagnose just by appearance, so instead it ’ s best to consider which causes may apply to your lawn. below we outline the most common causes of dead patches and how to remedy them. regular lawn care can help to avoid patchy grass – see our guides for more advice : drought and soil issues 1 ) irregular brown patches during dry weather – especially where tree roots run under the lawn or in areas where the soil is sandy and drains quickly cause : lack of moisture in the soil remedy : this is usually a temporary problem and dead grass will recover once rain returns. also see our advice on lawn care during drought 2 ) irregular brown patches on new lawns cause : buried builders ’ waste or rubble, or soil compaction due to heavy machinery remedy : remove the buried material or remedy the compacted soil, then re - seed or re - lay the affected areas of lawn 1 ) regular brown stripes or patches that appear after feeding the lawn cause : an overdose of fertiliser remedy : always follow the dosage instruction on the packet carefully – using too much can not only harm the environment, it can also scorch the plants you are trying to help. consider whether it is really necessary to feed your lawn. if you do decide to feed, take care to apply the correct dose evenly. if using a mechanical distributor, calibrate it carefully before use. ideally, apply fertiliser before rain, or water after feeding if no rain is forecast. controlled - release lawn fertilisers may be less likely to cause scorch. see the following guides for more advice on fertiliser use : 2 ) regular stripes or patches that appear after applying weedkiller or mosskiller cause : an overdose of lawn weedkiller or mosskiller. alternatively, if you have used a weedkiller nearby, it can be carried onto the lawn on footwear and appear as footprint - sized dead patches remedy : avoid using weedkillers ; consider removing weeds by hand or using other non - chemical control methods, or opt for a species rich lawn. if you do use a weedkiller, always follow the instructions on the packaging. see the following guides for more advice : 3 ) dead patches on raised areas of uneven lawn after mowing cause : cutting raised areas too short, which can weaken or kill the grass remedy : adjust the cutting height of your mower to avoid scalping the grass – see our guide to mowing for advice on this. level out bumps and dips in your lawn to ensure a more even cut – see our guide to repairing lawns for how to do this, along with how to repair the bare areas 4 ) irregular random patches that appear after mowing cause : spilt petrol and oil can kill grass remedy : avoid topping up fuel or checking oil levels on your mower when it ’ s on the lawn, and be careful not to overfill the fuel tank or exceed the recommended oil levels. fuel may also spill out when tipping up a mower to check or un"

Title: How to Grow and Care for Chicago Hardy Fig
until they are ripe because figs do not ripen off the tree. and be gentle picking them, as figs are delicate. chicago hardy figs are ready to harvest when they are a deep purple or brown, slightly soft to the touch. overripe figs are very soft. use pruners to cut the figs off the stems. how to grow chicago hardy fig in pots chicago hardy fig can be grown in a container but it won ’ t be reaching the same size as an inground plant. keeping an eye on the soil moisture and watering the tree frequently is crucial because containers dry out more quickly than garden soil, especially on hot days. water when the top 2 inches of soil feel dry to the touch ( insert your finger in the soil to check ). the drier the soil, the slower you need to water it so the soil can absorb the moisture ; otherwise, the water will just run through. pruning how to prune chicago hardy fig depends on your climate, and whether you grow your plant as a shrub or a tree. if you live in a cold climate and overwinter the plant indoors, keeping it small makes it more manageable. regardless of the pruning method, wear gardening gloves, as the tree ’ s sap may irritate the skin. for an in - ground plant in warmer climates, letting it grow with multiple trunks is the natural growth habit and the preferable option because it yields more fruit. but if space is an issue, you can grow it as a tree with a single trunk, usually the way it is sold as potted plants by nurseries. prune in january or february while the tree is still dormant. trim any branches that stand in the way of good airflow in the canopy, as well as any old, grey, and dead or diseased branches. but never remove more than a third of the tree at once. in a warm climate you might find some blackened fruit on the tree in the spring. these usually off - tasting figs, which are produced on the previous year ’ s wood, are called breba. remove them like commercial growers do, which conserves the plant ’ s energy and leads to a better main crop from the new wood in the fall. propagating chicago hardy fig propagation from tip cuttings is the easiest, more reliable, and fastest method. while propagation from seed is possible, takes at least three to four years for a tree to reach fruiting stage, and the outcome is unpredictable. for propagating chicago hardy fig, you need sharp pruners ( secateurs ), a 6 - inch deep pot filled with moistened sterile potting mix, and a greenhouse dome, or a half - gallon clear plastic bottle with the bottom removed. when the tree produces new growth in the early spring, cut a healthy - looking tip of 6 to 8 inches in length just below a leaf node. dip the cut end in rooting hormone and insert it in the soil of the prepared pot so that the leaf node is buried in the soil. place the greenhouse dome over the pot to create high humidity around the cutting. keep the pot at an ambient temperature at least 70 degrees fahrenheit and in bright but indirect sunlight. water regularly to keep the soil evenly moist. wait until the cutting has produced new leaves and roots before repotting it in a larger container, or in garden soil. potting and repotting chicago hardy fig a container the same size or slightly larger than the nursery container is usually adequate. when selecting a material, keep in mind that the container can get quite heavy and that you need to move it indoors for the winter. fill the container with well - draining potting mix and make sure it has large drainage holes. when the tree roots fill the container, or grow out of the drainage holes, repot the plant in a larger container. overwintering for outdoor plants, apply a thick layer of mulch around the root zone in the fall. another way to protect the roots is a plant blanket or frost bag. if your plant dies back to the ground in a cold winter, not all is lost — it often regrows from the roots in the spring. that ’ s why protecting them is crucial. container plants should be moved indoors when the leaves start to fall. don ’ t wait until the first killing frost. the plant does not need light during its dormancy period. you can store it in an unheated garage, shed, or basement. however, you do need to check the soil moisture on a regular basis. water it lightly when the top 2 to 3 inches feel dry to the touch, just enough so that the roots don ’ t dry out, taking care not to drench it. common pests and plant diseases chicago hardy fig can get leaf spots, which often happens when there is not sufficient air flow due to a dense canopy. other potential diseases include anthracnose, rusts, and blight. the tree might also be affected by root knot nematodes, scale, aphids, and mites. faq how long does chicago hardy fig live? under ideal conditions can be expected to live for 50 years or more. how long does it take a chicago hardy fig to produce fruit? the tree typically starts bearing fruit within two years. what ’ s the difference between chicago hardy and the brown turkey fig tree? brown turkey is a less hardy variety than chicago hardy, it cannot be grown outdoors below usda zone 7. explore more : gardening plants & flowers fruit sources the spruce uses only high - quality sources, including peer - reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles. read our editorial process to learn more about how we fact - check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. ficus carica'chicago hardy '. missouri botanical garden. newsletter sign up newsletter sign up by clicking “ accept all cookies ”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts. cookies settings accept all cookies"

User: Are these ants or spiders? I am staying in a condo in Sisters, Oregon. In the last couple of days, I found these little fellas on the kitchen counter. I first thought they were spiders with a long body and 8 legs, but a closer look shows 3 sections with 6 very long legs and two very long antennae. They don't seem to follow in a group, and not many are together at one time. I saw one, was able to lift it up on a piece of paper and carry it outside, then came back and spotted another. In all, I carried outside 6 of them in two days. They did not attempt to flee like ants when I picked them up with the piece of paper. They are reddish in color. I hope my photos attached help to identify them.

Title: Insects on Coral Bells - Ask Extension
Aphids feed on a wide variety of garden plants. Aphids are slow moving, soft bodied sucking insects that usually appear in clusters on new growth. More than 1,300 native species of aphids inhabit North America. They come in a wide range of colors from black to pink to white and pale green, and measure 1/16-1/4 inch long. Aphids are pear shaped and usually wingless, with two tubes, called cornicles, at the posterior end. Aphids cluster on leaves and stems, where they suck sap, causing curling and cupping of leaves. Severe infestations cause general loss of plant vigor and stunting, with reduced yields. Aphids excrete excess sugars and sap in a liquid called honeydew. This honeydew attracts ants and an air borne fungus called sooty mold. The ants feed on the honeydew. This food source is so valuable that some species of ants tend the aphids, and even take them into their shelters over winter. Such ants tend to aggravate the aphid problem, distributing them to new plants. Aphid populations can explode because of the insect’s ability to reproduce parthenogenetically (without fertilization). After one or two generations, winged aphids are born, and these fly off to other plants. When male and females mate towards the end of the season, eggs are produced, enabling the insect to overwinter. Aphids usually appear as the weather begins to warm; they will first be noticed on plant tips, near opening flower and leaf buds. It is a good practice to monitor susceptible plants, and then at first sight simply wash off the plants with a stiff jet of water. Cradle the plant tips in your hand as you wash off the pests. Sticky honeydew and sooty mold and be washed off with a mild soap and water rinse. These two methods are especially recommended for aphid attacks on edible plants. Adult aphids can also be killed by spraying plants with insecticidal soap or with the botanical insecticide neem. Take care to apply these treatments to the stems and the undersides of leaves. Severely infected annuals may not recover from aphid attack; it is perhaps better to dig these out and dispose of them. Releasing predator insects such as ladybugs and lacewings can be effective in reducing aphid infestations in the spring. Aphids are attracted to the color yellow, and this can be used against them. Bright yellow plastic dishpans make a good trap when filled with soapy water and set near infested or vulnerable plants. Properly fed plants tend to be less troubled by aphids. Too much nitrogen can be as bad as too little. Take care to use a well balanced fertilizer and water your plants regularly. Apply thick mulch in the summer to keep soil cool and moist. Try neem oil for spider mites."

philodendron? to address your droopy philodendron, check the soil moisture. since overwatering or underwatering can both cause drooping, ensure the soil is slightly moist but not waterlogged. improve drainage if needed. also, provide your green companion with bright, indirect light and maintain a consistent temperature without extreme fluctuations. finally, fertilize once during the growing season to encourage healthy growth and prevent overfeeding. other common philodendron issues some other common issues associated with this beautiful plant include : - philodendron leaves turning mushy : mushy leaves are mostly caused by overwatering or root rot. moderating your watering routine and inspecting your plant's roots for rot is recommended. you may need to repot your philodendron in fresh soil after cleaning the roots. - philodendron burnt leaves : exposure to direct sunlight is the primary cause of your philodendron's burnt leaves. to fix this, move your plant to a spot with bright but indirect sunlight. - philodendron pests and diseases : these plants often face pests like spider mites and aphids, and diseases like fungal root rot or bacterial leaf spot. reduce watering and improve drainage to minimize the risk of diseases. pests can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil and regular plant inspection. how do you revive a philodendron? follow these care tips to revive a dying philodendron : - trim any damaged leaves and stems. - place your plant near a sunny window, which receives bright but indirect sunlight. - keep the environment slightly humid. - feed your philodendron once or twice during the growing season. - regularly hydrate your plant to prevent it from drying. - repot your philo plant in fresh soil if you suspect root rot. - use a well - draining nutrient - rich soil mixed with a bit of perlite. philodendron leaf problems : faqs q : should i cut off brown philodendron leaves? a : yes! brown philodendron leaves are unlikely to become green again, so it would be sensible to cut them off. trim them just above the nodes to encourage the growth of new healthy leaves. q : what does an overwatered philodendron look like? a : symptoms of an overwatered philodendron include wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, mushy foliage and roots, and more. q : how do you know if your philodendron is underwatered? a : your philodendron is underwatered if its leaves turn yellow and brown from the tips. the foliage may also start to drop if your plant is thirsty. hydrate your plant thoroughly as soon as possible. q : how do i know if my philodendron has spider mites? a : if your philodendron has spider mites, you may notice fine ‘ webbing ’ on the leaves, discoloration on the foliage ( brown and yellow spots ), and a general decline in the plant ’ s health. q : how do you make a philodendron bushier? a : trim leggy philodendrons to promote bushier growth. overgrown vining varieties will also benefit from regular pruning. cut back your cascading plant if the vines have become too long. you can use some of the cutting to propagate your philodendron. related : pothos vs philodendron : key differences and similarities although easy to care for, philodendrons can still succumb to various leaf issues and other problems. those often mean incorrect watering, over - or underexposure to sunlight, lack of nutrients, or overfertilization. temperature fluctuations, poor humidity, pests, and diseases can also be the causes behind unhealthy - looking philodendron plants. luckily, most of these problems are fixable by making small adjustments to your plant ’ s care routine. in addition, grouping your philodendrons with other green companions, such as the chinese money plant, areca palm, or the stunning burgundy rubber tree can be beneficial, as this helps maintain good humidity levels around them."

Title: Hollyhock Leaves Look Like Lace :: Melinda Myers
Hollyhock Leaves Look Like Lace
The leaves of my hollyhocks look like lace. What is causing this and how can I prevent it?
Hungry caterpillars, sawflies and Japanese beetles can cause the damage you describe. The worm-like caterpillars and sawflies usually hide under the leaves or along the stems during the day and feed at night out of sight. Japanese beetles, on the other hand, are easy to spot. These numerous small coppery-green beetles eat and mate in broad daylight. I choose to cover up the damage on my hollyhocks rather than control the insects. Medium sized plants like ornamental grasses, daylilies and other perennials mask the unsightly foliage. This is less work for you and kinder to the environment. The plants can usually tolerate the damage, it just looks bad. If you can’t tolerate the problem or the Japanese beetles are decimating the plants, you can use an insecticide. Select one labeled for controlling these insects on flowers. Look for one of the more environmentally friendly products like, Neem, that kills many insects and deters Japanese beetle feeding or insecticidal soap that kills insects on contact with no residual control. And as always read and follow all label directions carefully.

Title: How to Identify and Treat Maple Bark Diseases and Afflictions

plant – all of which occurs mostly during the summer months. symptoms include a streaked and radiating stain in the trunk and roots, along with stunted leaf growth and gradual branch dieback. the progression of symptoms will eventually culminate in the plant ’ s death three to four years after the onset of infection. because the stain is internal, the disease has a high potential of going unnoticed until after the tree dies. prevention is all you can do for your maples when it comes to sapstreak, as there is no known cure. avoid inflicting wounds to the trunk and roots, and make sure to avoid summertime logging, as that ’ s a prime time for this disease to spread. remove trees as they become infected to prevent further spread throughout the grove or landscape. 7. sooty bark disease like sapstreak, sooty bark disease is caused by a fungal pathogen – cryptostroma corticale, to be exact. the fungus makes its way into a maple ’ s heartwood – the dense, nonliving wood at the core of a tree ’ s sapwood – after infiltrating and killing smaller branches. once it reaches the core of the tree, it spreads up and down the trunk, eventually traveling outwards to the bark. and when it has arrived, the disease blisters and kills the bark, along with producing dark, sooty - looking, spore - producing masses directly under the bark, hence the name. additional symptoms include dead twigs that often appear on a single side of the tree, trunk cankers, leaf wilt, soft rot, and the eventual death of infected maples. it ’ s important to scout out potential planting spots for signs of this disease such as black mold underneath nearby trees – it could save you a lot of hassle. if sooty bark disease prevention is a high - priority goal of yours, avoid pruning healthy trees during dry summer conditions, since sunburned bark is a prime entry point for c. corticale. if you find an infected tree, remove it and burn it, making sure to keep all parts covered during any necessary transportation from one area of the landscape to another. the best time to do this is during the rainy months, as this disease spreads the most in hot and dry weather conditions. as a pale white dude in missouri who loves being outside, i know a thing or two about damage from the sun. with every sunburn i receive, it feels as if my genetics are screaming at me to seek shelter, or refrain from going outside unless it ’ s gray and cloudy out. all of this to say : whenever i see a tree with sunscald, i truly feel for it. sunscald occurs when high temperatures and harsh sun exposure cause severe bark damage. it ’ s commonly seen on the trunks of young trees that have yet to develop enough durability to withstand the sun ’ s rays. early symptoms include reddish - brown, canker - esque discoloration and slight vertical cracks in the bark. damaged areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic tree guards. these covers will need to be left in place until the bark on the trunk has matured sufficiently or until the tree ’ s canopy is large enough to provide ample shade – both of which could take several years. other than cutting away exfoliated bark, there ’ s not much you can do for trees that have already been damaged by sunscald. proper care for an injured tree involves the same practices and methods that you would use for a perfectly healthy specimen, and you can read more about these in our guide to growing maples. hundred - foot rolls of brown kraft paper made from 100 percent recycled material are available via amazon. 9. trunk suffocation mulch can be very beneficial, don ’ t get me wrong – but only in goldilocks amounts. if your maple looks like it ’ s growing out of a volcano made of mulch, then you ’ ve piled it on a bit too thick and placed it too close to the trunk. too much mulch that ’ s piled on essentially suffocates the lower trunk, which leads to the death of inner bark tissue, which limits nutrient transport through the phloem. this weakens roots, leaving them malnourished and unable to take up resources for the tree, which leads to aboveground plant problems. a massive mound of mulch around the trunk also creates a moist entry point for pathogens and pests to infiltrate the now - decaying inner bark tissue. plus, it can easily overheat, which can prevent necessary cold - hardening come wintertime … or it may straight - up cook the inner bark of the tree in the summer, killing it in the process. to mulch properly, apply two to four inches – less for fine - textured materials, more for coarse textures – in mid - spring, spread in a three - to five - foot radius out from the trunk. make sure to keep the mulch two inches away from the trunk and root flares. maple bark disease : beat it with ease when it comes to plant care, learning about diseases and other health issues not caused by infectious pathogens is half of the battle. when you know what causes a disease or affliction, preventing it is simple. when you find out what cures an illness, fixing the problem is that much easier. maple bark may take second fiddle to the foliage, but it ’ s still an important part of the symphony, aesthetics - wise. now that you ’ re able to keep it healthy, you can rest easy, knowing that your maple tree ’ s full glory is within reach, and your plant is firing on all cylinders. any questions, remarks, or insightful in - the - trenches experiences can go into the comments section below. and if you ’ re now jonesing for some more maple guides, get your fix with these articles next :

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses :
- leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib.
- leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature.
- growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses.
- vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species.
- inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns.
- seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets.
- stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature.
- root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons.
- habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates.

EVIDENCE:
A tiny, transparent worm in your garden may be a friend or a foe. Identifying the creature is a challenge, but worth the effort. You don't want to wipe out an ally just because it's squirmy or ignore plant damage that could be prevented or mended solely because the cause is almost too small to see.

Probable Garden Worm Identification
If the worms in your garden are truly tiny, really colorless, and actual worms, they are most likely nematodes. Nematodes in gardens and landscape plants may be so small that they're only visible with a microscope, or they can be up to several inches long. Most are invisible to the naked eye. They are transparent or colorless — not white. Nematodes have no legs at all. Many pests called worms are actually caterpillars and have legs, but nematodes are limbless, unsegmented roundworms.

Beneficial Free-Living Nematodes
Free-living nematodes feed on bacteria and fungi, while other nematodes and protozoa are omnivores. These serve important functions in the complex world of healthy soil and are beneficial members of the microorganism population of your garden. They can help control certain plant diseases and insect pests and make nutrients more available to your plants.

Plant-Parasitic Nematodes, the Bad Guys
Parasitic nematodes are parasites, meaning they rely on another living organism to sustain them through their life cycles. There are species that infect humans and even nematodes several yards long that parasitize whales. But in your garden, you're likely to have tiny (about 1/50 inch) plant-parasitic nematodes, who are definitely bad guys.

The most common is the root-knot nematode, of which there are several varieties, which damage the delicate root systems of vegetables and perennials, causing stunted growth and possibly plant death. Infected plants are yellowed, wilted, and/or stunted. Pull them up and you'll see lumpy nodules on the roots that contain the nematodes and prevent your plants from taking in the nutrients they need. There are also foliar nematodes that damage leaves and stems.

Insect-Parasitic Nematodes, the Good Guys
Some nematodes attack insects instead of plants. These can be allies, as they sterilize, debilitate, or kill their hosts. You can purchase these beneficial nematodes at garden centers and through catalogs and safely disperse them in your garden and landscaping, because they are not a threat to plants or animals, but only their specific insect hosts. They can help control borers, caterpillars, grubs, weevils, and root worms.

Nematode Damage Control
While insect-parasitic nematodes may be doing some kinds of damage in your garden, you will want to minimize the damage done by plant-parasitic varieties. This can be difficult. First, ask your local extension service if they can help you definitively identify damaging nematodes in your soil. They'll tell you if they are able to test for nematodes and instruct you on how to bring in a sample for testing. Pull up and destroy infested plants to prevent further spreading of the bad nematodes. And consider solarizing your soil and letting it lie fallow for a year. This will kill most of the nematodes and starve out the survivors.

Title: Controlling Understory Fern Competition for Regeneration Success
an area, it is likely to dominate the understory following a harvest or other disturbance and interfere with the establishment and development of tree seedling regeneration. sometimes, simply walking the area and making a visual assessment of current fern cover is sufficient. in other cases, taking an inventory is necessary. inventorying fern cover entails estimating the percent completely covered with fern in a 1 / 10 - acre plot ( 37. 2 - foot radius ). the number of plots taken depends on the stand and variability across the treatment area. larger and more varied areas require more plots. table 1 provides guidelines for the minimum number of plots by treatment area. plots must be spaced evenly across the area. if fern cover is 30 percent or greater on 30 percent or more of the plots, action should be taken to reduce or remove fern cover. for more information on procedures for inventorying interfering plants, refer to the u. s. forest service publication managing timber to promote sustainable forests : a second - level course for the sustainable forestry initiative of pennsylvania. what is the best way to control fern? research has demonstrated that herbicides are an effective, practical, economical, and safe means of controlling fern understories. fire, however, stimulates the spread of fern, and mechanical weeding is nearly impossible. the u. s. forest service began looking at herbicides to control fern in the mid - 1970s. commercial applications using the herbicide roundup ( glyphosate ) began in 1979 using air - blast spray equipment mounted on tracked or rubber - tired vehicles. initial studies achieved high levels of fern control using a glyphosate herbicide ( e. g., roundup ) at the rate of 1 quart per acre. optimal dates for best control were from early july until fronds yellowed in mid - september ; however, a number of issues affected successful control. the first was \\\" fern tracks. \\\" researchers found that metal cleats on tracked vehicles and the sharp edges of new rubber tires broke fern rhizomes during treatment. this prevented herbicide translocation to all parts of treated plants. over a period of four to six years in partially cut stands, fern regenerated from the broken rhizomes to completely reoccupy the understory. the second issue encountered in some stands treated with glyphosate herbicide was that grasses and sedges became a problem. studies implemented in the 1980s found that the addition of a sulfometuron - methyl herbicide ( e. g., oust ) resolved fern tracks as well as grass and sedge reinvasion. sulfometuron - methyl is a soil - active herbicide that is readily taken up by fern rhizomes. it also has preemergent activity, which prevents undesirable grass and sedge seed from germinating. this work ultimately led to the prescription commercial applicators use today for controlling fern and other interfering plants, such as grasses and sedges, beech, and striped maple, in allegheny hardwood forests ( see table 2 ). this research informed vegetation management in other forest types as well. these treatments are widely used today across much of pennsylvania and the northeast. broadcast foliarapplication caution : desirable hardwood seedlings present at the time of application may be severely injured or killed by the active ingredient ( a. i. ) glyphosate. the a. i. sul

User > What can be done about my Magnolia damaged from a large fallen Tulip Poplar tree? I have a Tulip Poplar that cracked & fell on July 31, totaling my car, but fortunately no one was injured. I would appreciate your thoughts about what can be done with a beloved Magnolia that it damaged on the way down. Two significant branches were broken off, leaving a hole in the profile. One of the other branches in this area was weighed down and is not rebounding naturally, with its distal branches & leaves less than 2' from the ground. There is also an adjacent branch that is affected to a lesser degree. Two days later, a broken branch with dead leaves fell out of a tall adjacent tree, damaging a third branch, which is also important to me.
I wonder if at least one branch can be pulled up or supported and if it might grow stronger over time to return to its former position and help cover the hole left by the other two branches. Ideally, I'd like to support the third branch as well, but I do not want to knowingly cause further harm. I have had 3 tree services evaluate the Tulip Poplar and provide estimates for removal. Each mentioned stakes, cables, pulleys, or simply lightening the canopy. It was noted that there might be a problem if the remaining branches/trunk aren't strong enough, but the trunk is the most likely candidate for support. I want to help the tree but don't want to cause further damage.
I contacted two ISA Arborists, but they are unavailable for quite some time. I think it's best not to leave the damaged branch for that long if something can be done. I was hoping you might provide guidance so I have an idea of what the Tree Service might do to help.
I have a photo of the affected branch, but can't upload it.

Title: How to Identify and Treat Maple Bark Diseases and Afflictions
areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic tree guards. these covers will need to be left in place until the bark on the trunk has matured sufficiently or until the tree ’ s canopy is large enough to provide ample shade – both of which could take several years. other than cutting away exfoliated bark, there ’ s not much you can do for trees that have already been damaged by sunscald. proper care for an injured tree involves the same practices and methods that you would use for a perfectly healthy specimen, and you can read more about these in our guide to growing maples. hundred - foot rolls of brown kraft paper made from 100 percent recycled material are available via amazon. 9. trunk suffocation mulch can be very beneficial, don ’ t get me wrong – but only in goldilocks amounts. if your maple looks like it ’ s growing out of a volcano made of mulch, then you ’ ve piled it on a bit too thick and placed it too close to the trunk. too much mulch that ’ s piled on essentially suffocates the lower trunk, which leads to the death of inner bark tissue, which limits nutrient transport through the phloem. this weakens roots, leaving them malnourished and unable to take up resources for the tree, which leads to aboveground plant problems. a massive mound of mulch around the trunk also creates a moist entry point for pathogens and pests to infiltrate the now - decaying inner bark tissue. plus, it can easily overheat, which can prevent necessary cold - hardening come wintertime … or it may straight - up cook the inner bark of the tree in the summer, killing it in the process. to mulch properly, apply two to four inches – less for fine - textured materials, more for coarse textures – in mid - spring, spread in a three - to five - foot radius out from the trunk. make sure to keep the mulch two inches away from the trunk and root flares. maple bark disease : beat it with ease when it comes to plant care, learning about diseases and other health issues not caused by infectious pathogens is half of the battle. when you know what causes a disease or affliction, preventing it is simple. when you find out what cures an illness, fixing the problem is that much easier. maple bark may take second fiddle to the foliage, but it ’ s still an important part of the symphony, aesthetics - wise. now that you ’ re able to keep it healthy, you can rest easy, knowing that your maple tree ’ s full glory is within reach, and your plant is firing on all cylinders. any questions, remarks, or insightful in - the - trenches experiences can go into the comments section below. and if you ’ re now jonesing for some more maple guides, get your fix with these articles next :

User > I have a Daphne plant that I've had for over 22 years and is about 6 feet long and 4 feet high, huge and healthy and bloomed wonderfully again this early spring but now the leaves are wilting on about half the branches on one side. Some of the plant looks healthy but I'm afraid whatever it is, it's spreading to the rest of the plant. At first I thought it was a lack of water but now I'm not so sure. It resides under an eve of the house. I've checked for bugs and have sprayed the leaves off several times but I don't see any pests on it. I've had spider mites on a large plant about 6 feet away but I have managed to get rid of them. One more thing, I cut the plant back about 2 feet last year after it bloomed as it was taking over the sidewalk. Can someone help me figure out the issue please?

credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly"

User > Reviving old garden: I recently moved into a home that already has a fenced off area for a small garden. I’m new to gardening and want to start a vegetable garden. There is currently some leftover fabric covering the garden area and a lot of weeds. Should I remove the fabric and just prepare the soil in the ground for gardening? Or should I leave the fabric and put garden beds on top instead?

EVIDENCE:
One of the main reasons people build raised beds for vegetable gardens instead of planting directly in the ground is because it's often easier to fill a raised bed with a good soil than it is to try and improve poor soil in the ground.

Raised bed are commonly filled with either good topsoil and compost mix or something more like a soilless or a peat-based potting mix. I use a peat based potting mix for a raised bed I do square foot gardening in.

In either case the soil in your raised beds will be nicer than the soil in the ground. Nearby tree, shrub and plant roots may find their way into your raised bed soil and realize how nice it is in there and decide to stick around. They will compete for water and nutrients with the plants you want to put in your raised bed. The landscape fabric will help keep them out but some roots may still find their way in.

The depth of the soil in the raised bed should prevent weed seeds that are in the existing soil underneath from germinating.

If you have burrowing animals like gophers you may also want to use some hardware cloth on the bottom of your raised bed too."

User > Can I ask you for your opinion based on these photos of my Colorado Blue Spruce trees? Three arborists confirmed they have a needle cast disease. One of the arborists also mentioned the presence of borers and the need for injection. The other two only diagnosed them for needle cast. I read online that if the sap is white and puddling, it might be a sign of borer infection.

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2
what's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the Title: Insect Problems in the Vegetable Garden: Chewing Insects (News article for May 14, 2022; edited) As discussed last week, insect and mite pest problems can often be prevented or reduced by using good cultural practices. However, insecticides are sometimes needed to avoid significant losses. Since pest issues are easier to manage when the insects are smaller and fewer in number, it’s important to observe plants often. Before using an insecticide, it’s important to correctly identify the insect or mite causing the problem. Different insecticides are effective on different pests. This week, I’m writing about “chewers,” or insects that make holes of various sizes in various plant parts. Caterpillars, which are the larvae of moths and butterflies, can cause highly visible damage on plants. Some examples of caterpillar insect pests are hornworms (often found on tomato), corn earworm AKA tomato fruitworm, cabbage loopers, cutworms, and squash vine borers. While caterpillars cause some of the most noticeable damage to plants, there are a number of insecticide options for managing them. Products with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) as the active ingredient target caterpillars, specifically, and are some of the insecticides least likely to harm bees and other beneficial insects. Proteins in Btk products become toxic to caterpillars after they get into the insects’ digestive tract. Insecticides containing spinosad have efficacy against caterpillar pests and, while they’re not as selective for caterpillars as Btk products are, they pose less risk to beneficial insects than some other insecticides. However, they are toxic to bees prior to drying. The threat to bees can be reduced by spraying at times when bees are not likely to be active, such as the late afternoon or evening. Other active ingredients with efficacy against caterpillars include carbaryl and the pyrethroids (active ingredients ending in “-thrin,” plus esfenvalerate). These are broad-spectrum insecticides that pose more risk to beneficial insects, so it’s better to avoid using them when alternatives are available. To minimize the threat to bees, avoid spraying plants (including weeds around vegetable plants) while they’re flowering if possible, and spray at times when bees aren’t active. Besides caterpillars, beetle pests also have chewing mouthparts and make holes of various sizes in plants. Pests in the beetle order include flea beetles, Colorado potato beetles, cucumber beetles, bean leaf beetles, and weevils, including cowpea curculio. There are fewer effective options for beetles than for caterpillars. The pyrethroid insecticides, carbaryl, and malathion generally have efficacy against beetles. Spinosad is effective against Colorado potato beetle, specifically. Before using an insecticide, be sure to make sure that it’s labeled for use on the vegetable(s) on which you plan to use it. Read and follow all label instructions. For information about insects with sucking mouthparts (including aphids, whiteflies, stink bugs, and others), see the next article. Let me know if you have questions. Contact Mary Helen Ferguson. The cabbage looper is one of several caterpillar pests of cabbage and other plants in the mustard family.

in a sunny location. in healthy lawns, they rarely colonize in thick grass. lawn care and ant hills the presence of hills is most noticeable from may to early september. during the month of june ants become their most active, and they seem to prefer sandy soil for easy tunneling. one way to prevent ant hills is to keep the turf healthy. mow your lawn to a height of 3 inches ( 7. 6 cm ). water the grass deeply by setting up something like this rain bird drip irrigation garden watering kit from amazon to foster a healthy root system. and fertilize the lawn annually with some ready - made fertilizer that can be bought from home depot, as recommended for your type of turf. a healthy yard is the best prevention for ant hills. a thick lawn is simply less attractive to nesting ant queens. ants prefer dry, well - drained soil in an undisturbed low traffic area. how to control ants in lawns naturally if you are still wondering how to get rid of ants in yard situations, there are some natural solutions. unfortunately, the only way to completely eradicate the nest is to kill the queen. killing ants in your lawn can be tricky business because children and pets often use lawn areas for play and for traversing the garden. and, since ants form social communities which can occupy an area just a few inches ( 8 cm ) wide, up to a space that ’ s many feet across, ant populations and their associated problems will vary. if you have one of the huge ant groups entrenched in your lawn, you may want to take steps to eradicate them. for low ant populations, raking the lawn should be a regular maintenance task. this 18in wide metal leaf rake from amazon would be ideal. simply raking out the hills will scatter the population and can reduce hardened mounds from occurring. this simple step is effective if it ’ s done on a weekly basis from fall to summer. borax is a naturally occurring mineral salt that is not harmful to the environment. try using a borax and sugar water solution. mix equal parts sugar and warm water with a couple teaspoons of borax. soak cotton balls in the mixture and lay them near the nest. simply sprinkling borax powder around a mound, with or without added sugar, will dry the insects out from the inside once they have walked through, carried it into their nest and ingested it. borax can also be toxic, so prevent children and pets from entering the area. you can try a 3 percent solution of dish soap with water as a spray for an infested area. adding a spoonful of vegetable oil may make this more effective. using a protective face mask, you can sprinkle diatomaceous earth in and around the mound area. breathing dust from diatomaceous earth can be harmful. other ant treatments for lawns chemical treatments are rarely recommended. in the case of stinging ants, the queen needs to be killed. because she lives deep inside the earth, a topical application of chemical control will not work. there are some granular ant baits that, when scattered over the openin",

User: What are these tiny red bugs I have on my outdoor patio and some inside the semi enclosed patio on the concrete floor? I picked up a few with some clear tape and took pictures of them under a child's microscope I have, so they look much bigger than they are. In real life, they look like tiny red clover seeds that are walking around!

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2
\n\nlight colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others.\n\nTitle: Garden Pests: Tiny Transparent Worms\n\nGarden Pests: Tiny Transparent Worms\n\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\n\nA tiny, transparent worm in your garden may be a friend or a foe. Identifying the creature is a challenge, but worth the effort. You don't want to wipe out an ally just because it's squirmy or ignore plant damage that could be prevented or mended solely because the cause is almost too small to see.\n\nProbable Garden Worm Identification\n\nProbable Garden Worm Identification\n\nIf the worms in your garden are truly tiny, really colorless, and actual worms, they are most likely nematodes. Nematodes in gardens and landscape plants may be so small that they're only visible with a microscope, or they can be up to several inches long. Most are invisible to the naked eye. They are transparent or colorless — not white. Nematodes have no legs at all. Many pests called worms are actually caterpillars and have legs, but nematodes are limbless, unsegmented roundworms.\n\nBeneficial Free-Living Nematodes\n\nBeneficial Free-Living Nematodes\n\nFree-living nematodes feed on bacteria and fungi, while other nematodes and protozoa are omnivores. These serve important functions in the complex world of healthy soil and are beneficial members of the microorganism population of your garden. They can help control certain plant diseases and insect pests and make nutrients more available to your plants.\n\nPlant-Parasitic Nematodes, the Bad Guys\n\nPlant-Parasitic Nematodes, the Bad Guys\n\nParasitic nematodes are parasites, meaning they rely on another living organism to sustain them through their life cycles. There are species that infect humans and even nematodes several yards long that parasitize whales. But in your garden, you're likely to have tiny (about 1/50 inch) plant-parasitic nematodes, who are definitely bad guys.\n\nThe most common is the root-knot nematode, of which there are several varieties, which damage the delicate root systems of vegetables and perennials, causing stunted growth and possibly plant death. Infected plants are yellowed, wilted, and/or stunted. Pull them up and you'll see lumpy nodules on the roots that contain the nematodes and prevent your plants from taking in the nutrients they need. There are also foliar nematodes that damage leaves and stems.\n\nInsect-Parasitic Nematodes, the Good Guys\n\nInsect-Parasitic Nematodes, the Good Guys\n\nSome nematodes attack insects instead of plants. These can be allies, as they sterilize, debilitate, or kill their hosts. You can purchase these beneficial nematodes at garden centers and through catalogs and safely disperse them in your garden and landscaping, because they are not a threat to plants or animals, but only their specific insect hosts. They can help control borers, caterpillars, grubs, weevils, and root worms.\n\nNematode Damage Control\n\nNematode Damage Control\n\nWhile insect-parasitic nematodes may be doing some kinds of damage in your garden, you will want to minimize the damage done by plant-parasitic varieties. This can be difficult. First, ask your local extension service if they can help you definitively identify damaging nematodes in your soil. They'll tell you if they are able to test for nematodes and instruct you on how to bring in a sample for testing. Pull up and destroy infested plants to prevent further spreading of the bad nematodes. And consider solarizing your soil and letting it lie fallow for a year. This will kill most of the nematodes and starve out the survivors.\n\nTitle: Elderberry Caterpillars - Garden Helper, Gardening Questions and Answers\n\n2 http : / / photobucket. com / albums / y250 / weezie13 / by tbean on june 05, 2006 09 : 16 am aren't cabbage loopers green?

Title: Juniper Diseases & Insect Pests | Home & Garden Information Center
junipers grown in south carolina are relatively low-maintenance plants if planted in the correct location and given proper cultural care. there are several common problems that can cause browning of needles and dieback of entire shoots, especially when junipers are improperly planted or under stress from the environment. avoid many of these problems by selecting resistant varieties, avoiding overhead watering, and selecting a planting site with good drainage. more information is available in hgic 1068, juniper. twig & tip blights : junipers frequently exhibit dieback of shoot tips or entire shoots and browning of needles. needles may drop from the plant, and dark cankers may form at the junction of live and dead wood. this problem occurs typically during warm, wet weather conditions and is usually caused by one of the fungal organisms described below. phomopsis tip blight : this disease is caused by the fungus phomopsis juniperovora and begins by infecting the tips of branches smaller than the diameter of a pencil. the new, immature growth becomes infected while the darker green, mature foliage remains resistant to infection. infected twigs first become pale, then turn reddish-brown and finally become brown after death. scraping away the bark will reveal a sharp line between discolored, dead wood and healthy wood. watch for disease development during the spring or summer flush of new growth when warm, wet conditions are present. cercospora twig blight : this disease is caused by the fungus cercospora sequoiae var. juniperi. it begins by infecting the oldest needles that are located on the lower branches, inside of the plant. as disease development progresses, the needle browning spreads upward and outward. branch tips usually remain healthy and green. needles of spur branches turn brown and die usually in the late summer, leaving a plant with an inner crown devoid of foliage. this disease is sometimes confused with mite damage. prevention & treatment : each of these diseases requires similar methods of control. first, closely inspect the entire plant, since symptoms of tip blight and twig blight can be caused by other problems, such as drought, overwatering, or root injury. purchase disease-resistant varieties that are healthy with no evidence of dead or dying twigs. do not stress junipers by planting them in shaded or poorly drained locations. plant junipers in areas with good air circulation to promote rapid drying of the needles. do not crowd plants, and avoid using sprinkler irrigation. promptly prune and remove any diseased or browning branches as they occur. except on highly susceptible cultivars, pruning will usually control these diseases. if chemical control is necessary, fungicides are available to provide protection, but they must be applied before infection occurs. select a fungicide labeled for use on junipers containing one of the following : mancozeb, thiophanate-methyl, or copper fungicides. see table 1 for examples of products. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. kabatina twig blight : this disease is caused by the fungus kabatina juniperi. the symptoms are the same as described for phomopsis tip blight, except this fungus kills older (usually 1-year-old) twigs in the spring. damaged or stressed tissues are more susceptible to kabatina twig blight. cedar-apple rust : this fungal disease of apple, crabapple, various junipers, and eastern red cedar is caused by several species of gymnosporangium. the disease not only affects juniperus species, including eastern red cedar (juniperus virginiana), but requires an alternate host plant, most commonly apple or crabapple, to complete its life cycle. this disease spreads from junipers to apples or crabapples and then back to junipers. it can be a severe problem wherever these two types of plants are grown together. eastern red cedar is the most commonly infected juniper. on juniper, hard, brown, up to 2-inch diameter galls form near the ends of the branches in the summer. in the spring following a rain, the galls produce large, orange, gelatin-like tendrils, full of spores, which can blow a half-mile to infect nearby apple and crabapple trees. symptoms that occur on the apple trees appear as yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. in the late summer, these yellow spots form spores that are spread to the leaves and twigs of nearby junipers (within 2 miles) to infect them. prevention & treatment : select resistant varieties of apple (such as ‘enterprise’, ‘pristine’, ‘liberty’ or ‘redfree’) or juniper. prune out all galls on the juniper, if possible. do not plant apple or crabapple trees near eastern red cedars. if disease is severe enough to warrant control, or a particular specimen plant is affected, select a fungicide containing mancozeb or propiconazole. see table 1 for examples of products. do not use fruit for food if propiconazole products are used. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. more information is available in hgic 2000, apple and crabapple diseases. the following juniper varieties are generally resistant to phomopsis twig blight & cedar rusts ; - juniperus chinensis – chinese juniper - var. sargentii (sargent juniper) - j. communis – common juniper - j. squamata – singleseed juniper - j. sabina – savin juniper - j. virginiana – eastern red cedar - j. horizontalis – creeping juniper - j. horizontalis – creeping juniper - ‘wiltoni’ (‘blue rug’) phytophthora root rot : this root rot is one of the most serious and difficult-to-control fungal diseases that affects a wide range of plants in south carolina. it is caused by a soil-borne water mold (phytophthora cinnamomi), and the most common symptom is the slow decline of the plant. needles on the plant will become thin or sparse. some plants may die one branch at a time, until the entire plant dies. the centers of the roots change from white to reddish-brown and the outer layer of the roots separates easily from the core. high soil moisture and warm soil temperatures favor disease development. prevention & treatment : it is important to prevent this disease by cultural methods, since chemical treatment is ineffective once symptoms are noticed. avoid planting in poorly drained areas where phytophthora root rot thrives. heavy clay soils, areas that flood and sites where runoff water is a problem typically create root rot problems. plant junipers in raised beds, except in deep sandy soils. if you must plant in a site that has heavy clay or does not have good internal drainage, amend the site by thoroughly mixing a porous material, such as ground pine bark (not sawdust or peat), into the bed to a depth of 8 to 12 inches. avoid varieties that are the most susceptible to root rot. some highly susceptible junipers that are likely to be killed by the root rot fungus include : ‘andorra’, ‘bar harbor’, ‘parsoni’, ‘sargents’, ‘shore’ and juniperus procumbens ‘nana’. fungicides can be effective on a preventative basis only, and repeat applications are required. fungicides containing mefenoxam (subdue gr) can be applied in the home landscape to suppress disease, but it will not cure an infected plant. due to product cost and for accurate application, homeowners may want to hire a licensed landscaper to apply products containing these fungicides. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. insects & other pests bagworm : bagworm (thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) infests many shrubs and trees, but conifers (evergreens) are the preferred hosts. damage to plants results from feeding by the caterpillar, which causes loss of needles. mild infestations of this pest slow the growth of junipers. heavy infestations can kill a plant. the adult male is a dark-colored, hairy moth with a 1-inch wingspan and clear wings. the adult female is yellow and appears almost maggot-like. the larva (immature form or caterpillar) produces a carrot-shaped bag that it carries with it as it feeds. the bag is formed from silk that the larva produces. as it feeds, the larva adds bits of plant material to the bag. the bag is about 2 inches when complete. in south carolina, bagworms survive the winter as eggs in a bag. the larvae hatch during may. they spin their cases and carry them along as they feed. after further development, the adult male emerges from its bag in late summer. it locates an adult female in her bag. after mating, the female lays 500 to 1,000 eggs in her bag and dies. prevention & control : several parasites and predators feed on bagworms, generally keeping their numbers under control. removal of the egg-containing bags during winter and early spring is a very effective method for preventing problems before the next growing season. once removed, destroy or dispose of the bags or place them in a deep container, which allows beneficial parasites that may also be present in the bags to escape while retaining the bagworm larvae. if the infestation is severe or the bags are out of reach, spray with the bacterial insecticide bacillus thuringiensis (b.t.). insecticides recommended for use against crawlers include acephate, malathion, bifenthrin, cyhalothrin, and cyfluthrin. see table 1 for examples of products. read and follow all label directions and precautions before using. needle browning : these symptoms appear as needles that initially turn yellow, then brown and dry, before finally dropping from the plant. these symptoms can occur inside the plant nearest the trunk, on the tips or scattered throughout the plant. the entire plant may die if the condition is severe enough. there are many conditions that will cause needles to turn brown on junipers, including many diseases already discussed. a few reasons needles may turn brown are described below. drought & overwatering : these two problems cause similar symptoms on junipers. check to see if the ground is dry or frozen. overwatering causes the plant’s root to rot, therefore rendering it unable to take up water. dog urine : salts in the urine burn the foliage causing it to appear scorched. rinse the foliage if you suspect this is a problem. note : control of diseases and insects on large trees is usually not feasible, since adequate coverage of the foliage with a pesticide cannot be achieved. table 1. insecticides & fungicides to control juniper insect pests & diseases pesticides are updated annually. last updates were done on 09/24 by n. jordan franklin. originally published 05/99"

Title: Eliminating Tent Worms - Tent Caterpillar Home Remedy Solutions | Gardening Know How
Eastern tent caterpillars (Malacosoma americanum), or tent worms, are more of an eyesore or slight nuisance rather than an actual threat. However, getting rid of tent caterpillars is occasionally necessary. We can look at how to prevent tent worms and how to kill tent worms, if necessary.
Although often confused with fall webworms, tent caterpillars are quite different. Tent worms are active in early spring while webworms become active near fall. Tent worms make their tent-like nests in the forks of branches while webworm nests are located at the ends of branches. Fall webworms also enclose foliage or leaves within these nests. Tent caterpillars do not. Tent worms prefer wild cherry trees and other ornamental fruit trees. They will, however, nest in ash, willow, and maple trees as well. Other than their webs making trees appear unsightly, tent caterpillars rarely cause major problems. However, large colonies can significantly defoliate trees, as they feed on the leaves. This usually does not kill trees, which generally develop new leaves, but may make them more susceptible to disease and other problems. Tent caterpillar removal and tent caterpillar home remedy are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. Aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. They tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. This feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. One of the most noticeable signs of an aphid infestation is apple tree leaves turning yellow, which indicates that the tree is under stress from the loss of nutrients. Left unchecked, aphids can weaken your apple tree, making it more susceptible to other diseases and pests. Regular monitoring and natural control methods can help prevent serious damage. Apple-leaf blister mites are tiny pests that cause noticeable red or yellow blisters on the leaves of your apple tree. While the damage is mostly cosmetic, a severe infestation can weaken the tree over time. This weakening can result in reduced fruit production as the tree's energy is diverted toward recovering from the mite damage. Apple-leaf blister mites are particularly problematic in young trees or in cases where the infestation goes untreated. Regular inspection of leaves for blistering can help catch the problem early, ensuring that your tree stays healthy and productive. Speckled green fruitworms are caterpillars that feed on apple tree leaves and fruit. If you notice chunks missing from your apples, you may have these critters on your hands. How to keep apple tree pests at bay is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tree. Prevention is always easier than dealing with a full-blown infestation. Here are some effective natural strategies to protect your apple trees: - Prune regularly: Remove damaged or dead branches where pests may hide or lay eggs. This keeps your tree healthy and makes it harder for pests to establish themselves. - Encourage beneficial insects: Ladybugs and lacewings prey on harmful pests like aphids. Introducing or attracting these beneficial insects to your garden can naturally control pest populations. - Use organic treatments: Spray neem oil or horticultural soap on your tree to suffocate and repel pests. These organic solutions are effective without harming beneficial insects or the environment. - Net your apple trees: Netting is an excellent organic method to prevent pests, such as apple maggot flies, from laying eggs on your apples. It is a simple but highly effective way to safeguard your fruit. - Keep the area clean: Clear away fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris around the tree. This prevents pests from using the ground as a breeding site and helps reduce the chances of reinfestation. These methods will help keep your apple tree healthy and free from common pests. Organic vs. chemical control: What's best for your apple trees? When it comes to pest control for your apple trees, there are two primary options: organic and chemical. Our findings show that while chemical treatments can be highly effective at quickly eliminating pests, they come with drawbacks, such as potentially harming beneficial insects and negatively impacting the environment. Organic methods, such as using neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introducing natural predators, offer a safer, more environmentally sustainable approach. These methods work well for most situations. "

regular lawn care will help to keep your grass strong and resilient drought is a common cause of brown patches in summer several fungal diseases can weaken or kill grass dog urine can damage patches of lawn over application or incorrect use of fertilisers and weedkillers can damage or kill turf what causes dead patches? there are many potential reasons why bare patches may appear, from physical damage to fungal diseases and drought. it can be tricky to diagnose just by appearance, so instead it ’ s best to consider which causes may apply to your lawn. below we outline the most common causes of dead patches and how to remedy them. regular lawn care can help to avoid patchy grass – see our guides for more advice : drought and soil issues 1 ) irregular brown patches during dry weather – especially where tree roots run under the lawn or in areas where the soil is sandy and drains quickly cause : lack of moisture in the soil remedy : this is usually a temporary problem and dead grass will recover once rain returns. also see our advice on lawn care during drought 2 ) irregular brown patches on new lawns cause : buried builders ’ waste or rubble, or soil compaction due to heavy machinery remedy : remove the buried material or remedy the compacted soil, then re - seed or re - lay the affected areas of lawn 1 ) regular brown stripes or patches that appear after feeding the lawn cause : an overdose of fertiliser remedy : always follow the dosage instruction on the packet carefully – using too much can not only harm the environment, it can also scorch the plants you are trying to help. consider whether it is really necessary to feed your lawn. if you do decide to feed, take care to apply the correct dose evenly. if using a mechanical distributor, calibrate it carefully before use. ideally, apply fertiliser before rain, or water after feeding if no rain is forecast. controlled - release lawn fertilisers may be less likely to cause scorch. see the following guides for more advice on fertiliser use : 2 ) regular stripes or patches that appear after applying weedkiller or mosskiller cause : an overdose of lawn weedkiller or mosskiller. alternatively, if you have used a weedkiller nearby, it can be carried onto the lawn on footwear and appear as footprint - sized dead patches remedy : avoid using weedkillers ; consider removing weeds by hand or using other non - chemical control methods, or opt for a species rich lawn. if you do use a weedkiller, always follow the instructions on the packaging. see the following guides for more advice : 3 ) dead patches on raised areas of uneven lawn after mowing cause : cutting raised areas too short, which can weaken or kill the grass remedy : adjust the cutting height of your mower to avoid scalping the grass – see our guide to mowing for advice on this. level out bumps and dips in your lawn to ensure a more even cut – see our guide to repairing lawns for how to do this, along with how to repair the bare areas 4 ) irregular random patches that appear after mowing cause : spilt petrol and oil can kill grass remedy : avoid topping up fuel or checking oil levels on your mower when it ’ s on the lawn, and be careful not to overfill the fuel tank or exceed the recommended oil levels. fuel may also spill out when tipping up a mower to check or un

get the competitive edge. ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. the top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions. as a general rule, warm - season grasses only need to be watered once or twice a week. cool - season grasses require more frequent watering, up to three times a week in hot weather. turfgrass species growing in shade require less water than the same species growing in full sun. turfgrass growing on clay soils does not need to be watered as frequently as turfgrass growing on sandy soils, because clay soils retain water longer than sandy soils, and sandy soils drain water and dry out quickly. low application rates and / or division of total irrigation time into 2 or more applications per day are sometimes needed on clay soils to allow water infiltration and prevent puddling and runoff. for specific irrigation requirements for warm - and cool - season turfgrasses in various regions of california and at different sprinkler outputs, see the uc guide to healthy lawns and the lawn watering guide for california. additional resources are managing lawns in shade, managing lawns on heavy soils, and managing turfgrasses during drought. each turfgrass species has specific mowing - height requirements ( see mowing your lawn and grasscycling ). mowing some grasses too short can weaken the turfgrass and increase weed invasions. alternatively, if some grasses are not mowed short enough, the thatch layer can build up, reducing water penetration and weakening the turfgrass. mow grasses more frequently when they are actively growing. a standard guide is to remove no more than 1 / 3 of the leaf blade at each mowing. if too much is removed at one time, it can take some time for the grass to recover, giving weeds a chance to invade. lawns with weed invasions often appear uneven. mow weedy lawns frequently enough to avoid this patchy appearance and prevent flower and weed seed formation. be sure that mower blades are sharp enough so that the turfgrass is not damaged. for large areas, it is best to mow the least weedy section first and the weediest section last to avoid spreading weeds. washing the mower's deck and underside afterwards will remove weed seeds. the same applies if mowers are moved from weedy lawns to other lawns, to avoid transporting weed seeds and propagules. avoid mowing lawns when the soil is wet, such as after rain or irrigation ; moving a mower over wet soil can lead to compaction. to maintain a healthy lawn, follow fertilizing guidelines carefully. begin a regular fertilization program approximately 6 weeks after planting. in general, lawns need to be fertilized about four times a year while they are actively growing, with no more than 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application. see practical lawn fertilization for requirements for specific turfgrass species. regular thatch removal will help keep your turfgrass healthy and competitive with weeds. thatch is a layer of organic matter ( stems, stolons, roots ) that develops between the turfgrass blades and the soil surface. a thin layer of thatch is normal and even beneficial ;

weeds can occur in all lawns but rarely become problems in well - managed, healthy turfgrass. poor maintenance practices — such as improper fertilization, watering, and mowing — can weaken turfgrass and make it susceptible to weed invasion. total eradication of weeds isn ’ t realistic or necessary for most lawns. with good management practices, a lawn can be vigorous and attractive with little or no herbicide use. why is weed identification important? - different weeds may require different management approaches. - many weed species are associated with lawn conditions, such as overwatering, compacted soil, or low fertility. identifying the weed species can give an indication of the underlying lawn care problem, which can be corrected. - for help identifying weeds, visit ipm. ucanr. edu. prevent weed invasions with proper lawn care. - choose a turfgrass species well adapted for your area or needs. - uniform water coverage is essential ; regularly check sprinkler heads and adjust if needed. - water deeply and infrequently. - when mowing, remove no more than one - third of the leaf blade. mowing height can vary depending on turfgrass species. - fertilize with 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application up to 4 times a year. - heavy traffic can compact soil ; aerate the soil when grass is actively growing. - remove thatch if it is more than half an inch thick. - identify the weed species. - determine if there is an underlying lawn care problem such as improper fertilizing, watering, and mowing, and correct it. - remove weeds by hand when they are young and before they flower, set seed, form vegetative parts, or spread into patches. - overseed, patch, or renovate problem areas within the lawn. - before using an herbicide, address the underlying reason why weeds are invading. what about pesticides? - choose a selective herbicide that is labeled for use against your problem weed and can be used without damaging your turfgrass species. - nonselective herbicides can harm desirable turfgrass and other plants. - contact herbicides damage plant tissue but don't kill plant roots. these herbicides are most successful when applied to young weeds. - for more information on herbicides available for use on lawns, see the uc ipm pest notes : weed management in lawns. download a pdf of this quick tips. descargue un pdf de estos notas breves. pest notes : introduction weeds occur in every lawn, but they seldom become problems in well - managed, vigorously growing turfgrass. proper site preparation and turfgrass selection before planting are essential to give a new lawn a healthy start. once a lawn is established, poor maintenance practices that weaken it — such as improper irrigation, fertilization, or mowing — are the primary factors likely to predispose it to weed invasion. activities that lead to compaction also contribute significantly to turfgrass stress, making it easier for weeds to invade. an integrated weed management program can reduce most weed populations to tolerable levels and prevent large, unsightly weed patches. total eradication of weeds is not a realistic or necessary goal for most lawns and park turfgrass ; however, with proper maintenance a lawn can be practically free of weeds without the extensive use of chemicals. refer to the uc guide to healthy lawns ( see references ) for

Title: Troubleshooting Philodendron Leaves Turning Yellow or Brown
philodendron? to address your droopy philodendron, check the soil moisture. since overwatering or underwatering can both cause drooping, ensure the soil is slightly moist but not waterlogged. improve drainage if needed. also, provide your green companion with bright, indirect light and maintain a consistent temperature without extreme fluctuations. finally, fertilize once during the growing season to encourage healthy growth and prevent overfeeding. other common philodendron issues some other common issues associated with this beautiful plant include : - philodendron leaves turning mushy : mushy leaves are mostly caused by overwatering or root rot. moderating your watering routine and inspecting your plant's roots for rot is recommended. you may need to repot your philodendron in fresh soil after cleaning the roots. - philodendron burnt leaves : exposure to direct sunlight is the primary cause of your philodendron's burnt leaves. to fix this, move your plant to a spot with bright but indirect sunlight. - philodendron pests and diseases : these plants often face pests like spider mites and aphids, and diseases like fungal root rot or bacterial leaf spot. reduce watering and improve drainage to minimize the risk of diseases. pests can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil and regular plant inspection. how do you revive a philodendron? follow these care tips to revive a dying philodendron : - trim any damaged leaves and stems. - place your plant near a sunny window, which receives bright but indirect sunlight. - keep the environment slightly humid. - feed your philodendron once or twice during the growing season. - regularly hydrate your plant to prevent it from drying. - repot your philo plant in fresh soil if you suspect root rot. - use a well - draining nutrient - rich soil mixed with a bit of perlite. philodendron leaf problems : faqs q : should i cut off brown philodendron leaves? a : yes! brown philodendron leaves are unlikely to become green again, so it would be sensible to cut them off. trim them just above the nodes to encourage the growth of new healthy leaves. q : what does an overwatered philodendron look like? a : symptoms of an overwatered philodendron include wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, mushy foliage and roots, and more. q : how do you know if your philodendron is underwatered? a : your philodendron is underwatered if its leaves turn yellow and brown from the tips. the foliage may also start to drop if your plant is thirsty. hydrate your plant thoroughly as soon as possible. q : how do i know if my philodendron has spider mites? a : if your philodendron has spider mites, you may notice fine ‘ webbing ’ on the leaves, discoloration on the foliage ( brown and yellow spots ), and a general decline in the plant ’ s health. q : how do you make a philodendron bushier? a : trim leggy philodendrons to promote bushier growth. overgrown vining varieties will also benefit from regular pruning. cut back your cascading plant if the vines have become too long. you can use some of the cutting to prop

User > My White Oak tree is infected. A couple years ago, I discovered that the white oak tree in my backyard was being girdled by a large root from a sweet gum tree on my neighbor's property, so I removed the root. A good bit of rotten bark fell off where the root was girdling it, exposing bare wood. After about two years, the tree appears to be doing well and is growing over where the rotten bark was, and it does not show any signs of leaf browning. But it clearly has some sort of infection, as the base of the tree is discolored, smells like vinegar, and occasionally oozes a sort of foam from the bark. I would like to know what sort of infection this is and if there is anything I can do to treat it.

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2
light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the yellow sticky trap is my best friend. now — don ’ t freak out. i know, i know - small animals ( birds, lizards, etc ) can get caught on these and die. however, i ’ ve learned you can still use them but you gotta get crafty in how you hang them. a yellow sticky trap is a card coated with a sticky substance that attracts particular pests. it ’ s great at catching small flying insects. you want to keep the card size to no larger than 3x5. i punch a hole in mine and hang them below my netting so that they are in the main plant canopy. keeping it down in the plant canopy is key so that it ’ s less likely to be in a bird ’ s flight path. also, i ’ ve learned you want to make sure the card can swing. this keeps lizards off of them. if you fasten it tightly so it ’ s immobile, baby lizards will crawl on it and not be able to get off. leafhoppers are important to control and they are often overlooked because they don ’ t show physical damage to your plant quickly. they do chew on the plant but it ’ s not super noticeable. however, they are vector insects - meaning they can take a virus from one plant to another. and in this day and age, when dahlia viruses are becoming more common, controlling leafhoppers will help protect your dahlia plant stock. cucumber beetles - other than grasshoppers, these are probably the most destructive of dahlia pests. they can chew a bloom incredibly fast. if you begin to see them in your field / garden, you want to act quickly because this is a pest you don ’ t want getting out of hand. once again, organza bags are the most effective method. but a spinosad or pyrethrin spray will work too. one of the best things i did several years ago was to stop growing plants in the amaranth and squash plant families near my dahlias. amaranth is a magnet for cucumber beetles. so much so that i ’ ve completely cut it from my crop list. if you can ’ t do that, move it as far from your dahlias as possible. i do still grow small quantities of squash and cucumbers in my veggie garden, but i have it as far from the flower field as i can go ( and still be on my property ). so to sum it up - if you want a flawless dahlia, put an organza bag on it before the bud begins to open ( in the green stage as shown in the picture above ). if that option doesn ’ t appeal to you, then sprays and strategic plant placement are your best options. also employ the sticky trap. not only does the trap catch a lot of pests, but it ’ s pretty non - harming to you and others."

User: Soil pest issue? I bought some garden boxes to plant vegetables in this year. I ended up planting twice because nothing came up the first time around. The second plant yielded some growth, but the sprouts never matured (in all of the boxes). They stalled out and died back. I decided to check the soil this morning and found that one of my boxes contained these ugly things (Nematodes...I think). I hear Nematodes aren't all bad, but how do I know if I have the good ones or bad ones? I pulled at least 40 out of one small box and just gave up. I figured, if they are in one box, they are in all of them. I can't account for no growth of my vegetables otherwise.

User > I have what I believe is a Chinese magnolia that has a hole in the fork a few inches deep. What is the best way to prevent water from pooling in the fork while protecting the tree? My biggest concern is mosquitoes, but also the health of the tree. I thought about spray foam but not sure if that is good for the tree.

Title: How to Grow and Care for Lungwort

rot. lungwort will perform poorly when soil ph strays outside the 7 to 8 range, preferring neutral to alkaline soil. the shift in flower color from pink to blue is because the plants ph levels change as the growing season progresses. water these plants need a moderate amount of moisture and struggle in soil that is too dry or too wet. water whenever the soil begins to dry out due to drought, but don ’ t overwater to the point that the plant is sitting in soggy soil. temperature and humidity lungwort plants thrive in mild temperatures and are challenged in hot climates. they start growing as soon as the danger of frost has passed in the spring. hot summer weather might cause them to wilt ; however, they should perk up again once the cooler temperatures of fall arrive. fertilizer lungworts don't require frequent or heavy fertilization, which can reduce flowering. in the early spring, sprinkle a small amount of all - purpose garden fertilizer around the plant. mixing compost into the soil can also help to promote healthy growth. types of lungwort most lungwort varieties sold for garden use are cultivars of hybrids created by cross - breeding key species, especially p. saccharata, p. angustifolia, and p. longifolia. the exact parentage is often unclear, and these cultivars are often simply labeled pulmonaria. new cultivars appear regularly, but some current favorites include :'blue ensign': this very early bloomer has cobalt - blue flowers and solid dark green leaves.'raspberry splash': this variety shows dramatic clusters of raspberry pink and soft lavender flowers, with dark green leaves speckled with silver.'shrimps on the barbie': this variety has pink flowers and long green leaves speckled with silver.'trevi fountain': this version has unusually large cobalt flowers and longish medium - green leaves with silver spots.'majeste': this cultivar has pinkish flowers that gradually turn blue - violet. the leaves are long and lance - shaped, silver - gray with green margins.'excalibur': this clump - forming plant has silver leaves and long - lasting violet - blue flowers.'spilled milk': this hybrid has the familiar pink - transitioning - to - blue flowers. young leaves are tinged purple, changing to white as they age.'roy davidson': this plant has dark green leaves with silver - white spots ; the flowers are pale blue.'smokey blue': this plant has silvery spotted foliage with pink flowers that turn blue. p. officinalis'sissinghurst white': this plant has long, speckled leaves with pale pink buds that open to pure white blooms.'spot on': this plant has silver - speckled foliage and salmon buds that transition to blue flowers.'spot on '. credit : the spruce / grant webster pruning removing the entire flower stalk and the degraded leaves will encourage the plant to rejuvenate with fresh growth. you can also prune off leaves that degrade from especially hot or dry weather, as needed. some gardeners choose to simply mow off the tops of the plants as they go dormant during the dry, hot, midsummer period. if kept well - watered, the plants will rejuvenate as the weather cools. propagating lungwort

Title: Troubleshooting Philodendron Leaves Turning Yellow or Brown

philodendron? to address your droopy philodendron, check the soil moisture. since overwatering or underwatering can both cause drooping, ensure the soil is slightly moist but not waterlogged. improve drainage if needed. also, provide your green companion with bright, indirect light and maintain a consistent temperature without extreme fluctuations. finally, fertilize once during the growing season to encourage healthy growth and prevent overfeeding. other common philodendron issues some other common issues associated with this beautiful plant include : - philodendron leaves turning mushy : mushy leaves are mostly caused by overwatering or root rot. moderating your watering routine and inspecting your plant's roots for rot is recommended. you may need to repot your philodendron in fresh soil after cleaning the roots. - philodendron burnt leaves : exposure to direct sunlight is the primary cause of your philodendron's burnt leaves. to fix this, move your plant to a spot with bright but indirect sunlight. - philodendron pests and diseases : these plants often face pests like spider mites and aphids, and diseases like fungal root rot or bacterial leaf spot. reduce watering and improve drainage to minimize the risk of diseases. pests can be managed with insecticidal soap or neem oil and regular plant inspection. how do you revive a philodendron? follow these care tips to revive a dying philodendron : - trim any damaged leaves and stems. - place your plant near a sunny window, which receives bright but indirect sunlight. - keep the environment slightly humid. - feed your philodendron once or twice during the growing season. - regularly hydrate your plant to prevent it from drying. - repot your philo plant in fresh soil if you suspect root rot. - use a well - draining nutrient - rich soil mixed with a bit of perlite. philodendron leaf problems : faqs q : should i cut off brown philodendron leaves? a : yes! brown philodendron leaves are unlikely to become green again, so it would be sensible to cut them off. trim them just above the nodes to encourage the growth of new healthy leaves. q : what does an overwatered philodendron look like? a : symptoms of an overwatered philodendron include wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, mushy foliage and roots, and more. q : how do you know if your philodendron is underwatered? a : your philodendron is underwatered if its leaves turn yellow and brown from the tips. the foliage may also start to drop if your plant is thirsty. hydrate your plant thoroughly as soon as possible. q : how do i know if my philodendron has spider mites? a : if your philodendron has spider mites, you may notice fine ‘ webbing ’ on the leaves, discoloration on the foliage ( brown and yellow spots ), and a general decline in the plant ’ s health. q : how do you make a philodendron bushier? a : trim leggy philodendrons to promote bushier growth. overgrown vining varieties will also benefit from regular pruning. cut back your cascading plant if the vines have become too long. you can use some of the cutting to propagate new plants.

shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such"

User > I'm wondering if there are suggestions for cover crops or intercropping plants we can use in our roughly 12x12 full-sun community garden raised bed to help keep weeds down and maintain moisture. We've planted veggie seedlings in three raised rows with walkways between. The area was weed covered when we acquired it, so we put down tarps to smother the weeds. To continue to help control the weeds and maintain moisture, we kept landscape fabric on the walkways and on the row with squash and eggplant (also under insect netting for the time being) and the row with bush beans and peppers. We have a silage tarp on the row with tomatoes. But we're finding that the tarps impede watering, so we're looking for a vegetative option to the tarps on the first two rows (we want to keep the silage on the tomatoes). We made the rows a little higher and rounded than we intended, so this is probably adding to the runoff issues. Would it make sense to remove the tarps and plant a cover crop or a companion veggie among the veggies to avoid bare ground and help with water retention? If so, what would you recommend?

Title: How to Identify and Treat Maple Bark Diseases and Afflictions

when it comes to maple trees, the foliage gets all the attention … and why wouldn ’ t it? in addition to having an iconic shape and providing bountiful shade from the sun, acer leaves reveal beautiful shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. a maple ’ s foliage is arguably its best feature. but the bark of a maple plays an ornamental supporting role to the leaves, taking center stage once the defoliated trees go dormant. we link to vendors to help you find relevant products. if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. with smooth bark that roughens and fissures to create interesting textures with age, acer bark is a gorgeous part of the tree that is often overlooked. unfortunately, this beautiful bark isn ’ t immune to harm. whether it ’ s due to a disease, environmental condition, or just faulty cultivation, there are some afflictions that can really take a toll on your trees. in this guide to identifying and treating maple bark diseases, we ’ ll cover the main threats you should keep an eye out for, how to treat these issues when they come up, and even how to prevent them from occurring in the first place. here ’ s a quick peek at the potential bark issues that we ’ ll cover up ahead : 9 common maple bark afflictions 1. burr knots and galls both burr knots and galls look like strange, sickly - looking lumps on tree trunks or branches … but there ’ s a bit more to them than that. burr knots actually form from small adventitious roots or bud tissues that don ’ t quite form shoots, and tend to grow in warm, humid conditions. they grow larger and more knotted as the tree matures. although they may look less than attractive on the tree, burr knots are actually prized by woodworkers for the unique swirls and patterns that they contain. galls, on the other hand, could be more accurately described as tumors, since they ’ re usually caused by bacteria or infectious material left behind by pests. the infectious agent spurs the gall to grow uncontrollably, and a gall can range in size from a half - inch to more than a foot in diameter. burr knots can easily break in frosty or windy conditions, provide easy access points for pests and pathogens, and even limit the flow of nutrients through the phloem if they manage to grow together in a mass of multiple knots. galls also block nutrients from flowing throughout the plant, in addition to looking even more contorted and irregular than burr knots. both burr knots and galls leave plant growth compromised as they block the healthy movement of nutrients. this tends to manifest as stunted growth or overall decline. to prevent burr knots, it ’ s imperative to keep the trunk dry. avoid growing vegetation under the canopy, or wrapping your trunk in a tree guard of any kind. skipping the former will prevent adjacent evapotranspiration from moistening your tree, while the latter will allow your tree to remain aired out and dry. if it ’ s too late for preventive care, feel free to cut out burr knots, as long as there are only a few of them. hey, maybe you ’ ll end up with some cool lumber to use in woodworking! galls are best prevented by avoiding injury to your trees and managing pests. you can cut them out if they ’ re already present on your tree.

Title: Plant Identification Guides
Plant identification guides can aid biologists with proper identification of plant species in the field, such as when determining whether an area meets the criteria for classification as a wetland, or in assessing the floristic quality of a site for natural areas protection.
The Commission has also prepared lists of plants suitable for landscaping in Southeastern Wisconsin. Landscaping guides and invasive species eradication information can be found on the Zoning & Ordinances page.

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses : - leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib. - leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature. - growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses. - vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species. - inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns. - seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets. - stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature. - root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons. - habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates. to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities. identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a boat - shaped tip, and a prominent midrib on the upper side. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads through rhizomes, creating a dense, interconnected turf. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : pyramid - shaped panicle with branches that spread outward

Title: How To Grow And Care For Drift Roses
is recommended to test your soil drainage in the spot where you plan to plant them beforehand. don't overwater your roses — too much watering can cause root rot and other diseases. if you are planting your roses in a container, most garden soils will work perfectly — make sure it has a ph balance of 5. 5 to 6. 5, as drift roses do best in this acidity level. water after first planting your drift roses, make sure to deep soak the area to approximately the depth of the height of the root ball. as your new floral addition enters into its first growing season — which lasts from spring to fall — water just enough to keep the soil damp to moist. let the area completely dry out before watering again — this will help prevent root rot. because it is a drought - resistant plant, after its first growing season, one will only need to water it in summer drought conditions or when the plant is looking extra wilted or its stems or leaves are drooping. ensure to prevent root rot by letting the soil dry out completely between waterings, especially in containers, where overwatering is more likely. temperature and humidity some varieties of drift roses, such as coral drift, are winter hardy as well as heat and drought - tolerant. they tolerate humidity, and they like full sun but will tolerate some shade. fertilizer drift roses don't need fertilizing, but they do like it. however, make sure not to fertilize your roses until they have gone through one full growing season. use a balanced fertilizer or a fertilizer made for roses. fertilize your plants about once every six weeks during the growing period, but make sure not to use fertilizer in the late summer because the plant will be preparing for winter at that time. types of drift rose drift roses come in a variety of colors to suit any garden landscape. sweet drift ( rosa ‘ meiswetdom ’ ) has pink blooms from spring through the first hard freeze. white drift ( rosa ‘ meizorland ’ ) has double flowers shaped like miniature roses. coral drift ( rosa ‘ meidrifora ’ ) is a winter - hardy and drought - tolerant mounding shrub that blooms from spring to fall. apricot drift ( rosa ‘ meimirrote ’ ) has double flowers that are best suited for small gardens and lining walkways. buttercream drift ( rosa ‘ meidevi ’ ) features pale yellow cuplike blooms and works well in all types of gardens. popcorn drift ( rosa ‘ novarospop ’ ) has pale yellow blooms that fade to white and bloom continually all season. pruning while drift roses don't require pruning, a good trim will help the plant become bushier and denser and promote growth. drift roses should be pruned in the later winter or early spring once a year to about a 6 - to 8 - inch height. propagating drift roses because these are trademarked flowers, they cannot be propagated or grown from seed. it is a violation of copyright law. to add more drift roses to the garden, they must be purchased. how to plant drift roses in the ground decide on a place to plant your drift roses. they will need at least six hours of direct sunlight a day, so choose a sunny patch where there is not much shade. use your shovel to dig a hole about three times as wide as the root ball and about as deep as it is. remove your rose from the container, and use your fingers to loosen the root a bit at the plant's base. plant your roses, making sure the base of the plant is at ground level. add extra soil to the bottom of the hole if necessary to ensure it is at the right height. fill in empty spaces around the plant with soil until it stands up on its own. aerate the soil with your hands as you put it back in the ground. soak the area, and allow it to fully drain out before watering again. potting and repotting drift roses choose a plant container bigger than your dwarf - sized drift roses — at least two sizes larger and with adequate drainage. this will give your drift roses some room to grow. add potting soil into your container, leaving room to place the rose. add the rose into the soil, making sure the base of your plant is level with the top of the soil's height. add soil around the plant, leaving only about 1. 5 inches at the top of the container empty. water your plant thoroughly and allow it to drain completely. water twice a week when in a container — make sure your plant gets ample time to drain completely before watering again. place your plant in a sunlit area, ensuring it gets at least six hours of sunlight a day. overwintering in areas with harsh winters, make sure to add 2 to 3 inches of mulch, pine needles, or leaves around the base of the plant. cold winds may dry out the plant, so protect it by wrapping it in burlap. heavy snow insulates the plant. in the spring, remove any burlap or mulch that is too deep, and prune away any dead pieces. if it looks like the drift rose didn't survive a harsh winter, cut it back to 6 inches to encourage new growth. this way the plant can focus its energy on the roots. new growth may take a few weeks to appear. roses in containers can be left out for the first few frosts, but then they should be moved to a garage or basement for the winter for protection from winter temperatures. check that the plant does not dry out completely and has some moisture. in spring, after the threat of frost has passed, return the plant outdoors. common pests & plant diseases drift roses are fairly resistant when it comes to common plant diseases like powdery mildew, rust, and black spot. they can be susceptible to chilli thrips and cercospora leaf spot. chilli thrips may cause brown spots or leaf curling. to treat thrips, apply horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to the leaves. to treat leaf spot, remove any infected leaves and carefully dispose of them. remove and dispose of any debris around the plant. apply a fungicide to help control the problem. avoid overwatering and be sure to use clean pruners for any trimming. a virus called rose rosette disease can cause deformed leaves, flowers, and stems in both drift and'knock out'roses. signs include enlarged stems, elongated shoots, excessive amounts of thorns, or a dark red tint to the shrub's foliage. there is no treatment for this virus, so you will need to dig up and dispose of any infected plants. how to get drift roses to bloom these roses bloom every five or six weeks from april through november. deadheading is not required to encourage new blooms. if you prefer a neater appearance, remove wilted and faded blooms. regularly remove any fallen flowers to discourage pests. common problems with drift roses drift roses don't encounter many problems in the garden. they are pretty easy to care for and resist many issues. if you notice the leaves aren't as green as they used to be, this could be the reason : leaves turning yellow during summers with exceptionally high heat, the leaves on a drift rosebush may turn yellow and drop. this helps it cool down. if temperatures aren ’ t to blame, other causes can be too much water or fertilizer. water the base of the plant a few times a week during the morning, making sure the soil is moist 12 to 18 inches deep. frequently asked questions do deer eat drift roses? yes, deer will eat these roses. since they bloom every five or six weeks, it won ’ t be long before they are full of flowers again. use deer repellent to keep pesky visitors away. do drift roses attract pollinators? drift roses bloom nonstop throughout the season, and pollinators like butterflies and hummingbirds are drawn to their blooms. what is an alternative to drift roses? for long - lasting color, encore azaleas bloom in spring, summer, and fall in a variety of colors. they can also take full sun or part shade and don ’ t require heavy pruning or deadheading. explore more : gardening ideas gardening flowers roses was this page helpful? thanks for your feedback! tell us why! other submit sources southern living is committed to using high -

Title: Identifying Common Household Insect Pests | University of Maryland Extension
Key points to help in identifying household insects
Proper identification is the first step prior to managing any pest. Submit photos and questions to Ask Extension if you need assistance.
In most circumstances, an infestation can be brought under control without hiring a pest control company.
Proper identification, sanitation, managing moisture in and around the home, vacuuming, sealing off insect entry points, proper firewood storage, using a dehumidifier are some examples of management techniques to help reduce or eliminate an indoor insect problem.
Avoid using pesticides indoors when at all possible to help minimize exposure. The risk of exposure to toxic materials is much higher indoors than outdoors. Insecticides do not break down indoors nearly as fast as outdoors. Indoors, pesticides are not exposed to degradation by temperature changes, wind, rain, soil microorganisms, etc.

Selecting pest control companies and pesticides
Shop for a pest control company as you would for a doctor or any other professional service.
Begin with recommendations from friends and neighbors.
Most companies provide free estimates, at which time they discuss a treatment plan, cost, and of equal importance warranties.
Compare recommended treatment programs and estimates among several companies.
A number of termiticides are registered for termite control; the use of different compounds and formulations varies among companies. Companies should fully disclose information on the chemical that they will be using in the treatment.
Companies that are members of the Maryland Pest Control Association and the National Pest Control Association have access to all current treatment practices. You can check a company's reputation by calling the Better Business Bureau.
Make certain that the company has an active certification license from the Maryland Department of Agriculture Pesticide Regulation Section.
If you have had a termite problem, it is wise to purchase a contract that includes an annual inspection and re-treatment if necessary. Termite control is difficult. The best company can do the best job and still not completely solve the problem.

User > I have an updated question about root flare and a question about yellow tree leaves. Per your reply about my previously sent photos of my container-grown service berry tree trunk after I had removed growing medium from around the trunk, you suggested that I remove some more of the growing medium in order to better expose the root flare. The first two attached photos show the front and rear sides of the trunk/soil interface. Are the structures at the red arrows part of the root flare, the adventitious roots (which you said could be cut off), or the actual main roots? I planted the tree two days ago and at this time, I could pull it upward a bit if you recommend that I do so, or I could cover the structures at the red arrows with soil. Please advise.

Title: How to Identify and Treat Maple Bark Diseases and Afflictions
areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic tree guards. these covers will need to be left in place until the bark on the trunk has matured sufficiently or until the tree ’ s canopy is large enough to provide ample shade – both of which could take several years. other than cutting away exfoliated bark, there ’ s not much you can do for trees that have already been damaged by sunscald. proper care for an injured tree involves the same practices and methods that you would use for a perfectly healthy specimen, and you can read more about these in our guide to growing maples. hundred - foot rolls of brown kraft paper made from 100 percent recycled material are available via amazon. 9. trunk suffocation mulch can be very beneficial, don ’ t get me wrong – but only in goldilocks amounts. if your maple looks like it ’ s growing out of a volcano made of mulch, then you ’ ve piled it on a bit too thick and placed it too close to the trunk. too much mulch that ’ s piled on essentially suffocates the lower trunk, which leads to the death of inner bark tissue, which limits nutrient transport through the phloem. this weakens roots, leaving them malnourished and unable to take up resources for the tree, which leads to aboveground plant problems. a massive mound of mulch around the trunk also creates a moist entry point for pathogens and pests to infiltrate the now - decaying inner bark tissue. plus, it can easily overheat, which can prevent necessary cold - hardening come wintertime … or it may straight - up cook the inner bark of the tree in the summer, killing it in the process. to mulch properly, apply two to four inches – less for fine - textured materials, more for coarse textures – in mid - spring, spread in a three - to five - foot radius out from the trunk. make sure to keep the mulch two inches away from the trunk and root flares. maple bark disease : beat it with ease when it comes to plant care, learning about diseases and other health issues not caused by infectious pathogens is half of the battle. when you know what causes a disease or affliction, preventing it is simple. when you find out what cures an illness, fixing the problem is that much easier. maple bark may take second fiddle to the foliage, but it ’ s still an important part of the symphony, aesthetics - wise. now that you ’ re able to keep it healthy, you can rest easy, knowing that your maple tree ’ s full glory is within reach, and your plant is firing on all cylinders. any questions, remarks, or insightful in - the - trenches experiences can go into the comments section below. and if you ’ re now jonesing for some more maple guides, get your fix with these articles next :

User > Apple rust on Eastern Red Cedar? I first noticed this growth on one of my Eastern Red Cedars. After looking closely, I see that all three eastern red cedars in my yard have the same type of growth. They all have the rust looking patches on the branches in different areas too. Could this be apple rust disease? If it is, are any methods of treating it better than others?

the fungus kabatina juniperi. the symptoms are the same as described for phomopsis tip blight, except this fungus kills older ( usually 1 - year - old ) twigs in the spring. damaged or stressed tissues are more susceptible to kabatina twig blight. cedar - apple rust : this fungal disease of apple, crabapple, various junipers, and eastern red cedar is caused by several species of gymnosporangium. the disease not only affects juniperus species, including eastern red cedar ( juniperus virginiana ), but requires an alternate host plant, most commonly apple or crabapple, to complete its life cycle. this disease spreads from junipers to apples or crabapples and then back to junipers. it can be a severe problem wherever these two types of plants are grown together. eastern red cedar is the most commonly infected juniper. on juniper, hard, brown, up to 2 - inch diameter galls form near the ends of the branches in the summer. in the spring following a rain, the galls produce large, orange, gelatin - like tendrils, full of spores, which can blow a half - mile to infect nearby apple and crabapple trees. symptoms that occur on the apple trees appear as yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. in the late summer, these yellow spots form spores that are spread to the leaves and twigs of nearby junipers ( within 2 miles ) to infect them. prevention & treatment : select resistant varieties of apple ( such as ‘ enterprise ’, ‘ pristine ’, ‘ liberty ’ or ‘ redfree ’ ) or juniper. prune out all galls on the juniper, if possible. do not plant apple or crabapple trees near eastern red cedars. if disease is severe enough to warrant control, or a particular specimen plant is affected, select a fungicide containing mancozeb or propiconazole. see table 1 for examples of products. do not use fruit for food if propiconazole products are used. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. more information is available in hgic 2000, apple and crabapple diseases. the following juniper varieties are generally resistant to phomopsis twig blight & cedar rusts ; - juniperus chinensis – chinese juniper - var. sargentii ( sargent juniper ) - j. communis – common juniper - j. squamata – singleseed juniper - j. sabina – savin juniper - j. virginiana – eastern red cedar - j. horizontalis – creeping juniper - j. horizontalis – creeping juniper - ‘ wiltoni ’ ( ‘ blue rug ’ ) phytophthora root rot : this root rot is one of the most serious and difficult - to - control fungal diseases that affects a wide range of plants in south carolina. it is caused by a soil - borne water mold ( phytophthora cinnamomi ), and the most common symptom is the slow decline of the plant. needles on the plant will become thin or sparse. some plants may die one branch at a time, until the entire plant dies. the centers of the roots change from white to reddish - brown and the outer layer of the roots separates easily from the core. high soil moisture and warm soil temperatures favor disease development. prevention & treatment : it is important to prevent this disease by cultural methods, since chemical treatment is ineffective once symptoms are noticed. avoid planting in poorly drained

intervention are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. they tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. this feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. one of the most noticeable signs of an aphid infestation is apple tree leaves turning yellow, which indicates that the tree is under stress from the loss of nutrients. left unchecked, aphids can weaken your apple tree, making it more susceptible to other diseases and pests. regular monitoring and natural control methods can help prevent serious damage. apple - leaf blister mites apple - leaf blister mites are tiny pests that cause noticeable red or yellow blisters on the leaves of your apple tree. while the damage is mostly cosmetic, a severe infestation can weaken the tree over time. this weakening can result in reduced fruit production as the tree's energy is diverted toward recovering from the mite damage. apple - leaf blister mites are particularly problematic in young trees or in cases where the infestation goes untreated. regular inspection of leaves for blistering can help catch the problem early, ensuring that your tree stays healthy and productive. speckled green fruitworm speckled green fruitworms are caterpillars that feed on apple tree leaves and fruit. if you notice chunks missing from your apples, you may have these critters on your hands. how to keep apple tree pests at bay keeping apple tree pests at bay is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tree. prevention is always easier than dealing with a full - blown infestation. here are some effective natural strategies to protect your apple trees : - prune regularly : remove damaged or dead branches where pests may hide or lay eggs. this keeps your tree healthy and makes it harder for pests to establish themselves. - encourage beneficial insects : ladybugs and lacewings prey on harmful pests like aphids. introducing or attracting these beneficial insects to your garden can naturally control pest populations. - use organic treatments : spray neem oil or horticultural soap on your tree to suffocate and repel pests. these organic solutions are effective without harming beneficial insects or the environment. - net your apple trees : netting is an excellent organic method to prevent pests, such as apple maggot flies, from laying eggs on your apples. it is a simple but highly effective way to safeguard your fruit. - keep the area clean : clear away fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris around the tree. this prevents pests from using the ground as a breeding site and helps reduce the chances of reinfestation. these methods will help keep your apple tree healthy and free from common pests. organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees? when it comes to pest control for your apple trees, there are two primary options : organic and chemical. our findings show that while chemical treatments can be highly effective at quickly eliminating pests, they come with drawbacks, such as potentially harming beneficial insects and negatively impacting the environment. organic methods, such as using neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introducing natural predators, offer a safer, more environmentally sustainable approach. these methods work well for most situations, though they may require more frequent application. in cases of severe infestations, chemical treatments may be necessary to prevent significant damage to your trees. ultimately, it's about finding the right balance between protecting your apple trees and aligning with your gardening values. dealing with apple tree pests can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies in place, your apple trees will remain healthy and productive for years to come. from tackling apple tree rust treatment to addressing orange spots on apple tree leaves, knowing how to manage pests is crucial for a thriving harvest. if you're looking for the best disease resistant apple trees or more tips on how to keep bugs off apple trees naturally, raintreenursery has a wide selection of varieties and expert resources to guide you. as trusted experts in home gardening, we're committed to helping you grow the healthiest, most productive apple trees possible. visit raintreenursery today to explore our options and get started on your journey to successful apple growing! if you want to learn more, why not check out this article below : - will apples ripen off the tree - pruning apple trees - how long does it take for an apple tree to grow?

plant – all of which occurs mostly during the summer months. symptoms include a streaked and radiating stain in the trunk and roots, along with stunted leaf growth and gradual branch dieback. the progression of symptoms will eventually culminate in the plant ’ s death three to four years after the onset of infection. because the stain is internal, the disease has a high potential of going unnoticed until after the tree dies. prevention is all you can do for your maples when it comes to sapstreak, as there is no known cure. avoid inflicting wounds to the trunk and roots, and make sure to avoid summertime logging, as that ’ s a prime time for this disease to spread. remove trees as they become infected to prevent further spread throughout the grove or landscape. 7. sooty bark disease like sapstreak, sooty bark disease is caused by a fungal pathogen – cryptostroma corticale, to be exact. the fungus makes its way into a maple ’ s heartwood – the dense, nonliving wood at the core of a tree ’ s sapwood – after infiltrating and killing smaller branches. once it reaches the core of the tree, it spreads up and down the trunk, eventually traveling outwards to the bark. and when it has arrived, the disease blisters and kills the bark, along with producing dark, sooty - looking, spore - producing masses directly under the bark, hence the name. additional symptoms include dead twigs that often appear on a single side of the tree, trunk cankers, leaf wilt, soft rot, and the eventual death of infected maples. it ’ s important to scout out potential planting spots for signs of this disease such as black mold underneath nearby trees – it could save you a lot of hassle. if sooty bark disease prevention is a high - priority goal of yours, avoid pruning healthy trees during dry summer conditions, since sunburned bark is a prime entry point for c. corticale. if you find an infected tree, remove it and burn it, making sure to keep all parts covered during any necessary transportation from one area of the landscape to another. the best time to do this is during the rainy months, as this disease spreads the most in hot and dry weather conditions. as a pale white dude in missouri who loves being outside, i know a thing or two about damage from the sun. with every sunburn i receive, it feels as if my genetics are screaming at me to seek shelter, or refrain from going outside unless it ’ s gray and cloudy out. all of this to say : whenever i see a tree with sunscald, i truly feel for it. sunscald occurs when high temperatures and harsh sun exposure cause severe bark damage. it ’ s commonly seen on the trunks of young trees that have yet to develop enough durability to withstand the sun ’ s rays. early symptoms include reddish - brown, canker - esque discoloration and slight vertical cracks in the bark. damaged areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic

User > Why is my podocarpus dying out? I have some podocarpus bushes in front of my house that were planted approximately 8 months ago. Over the last couple of months, parts of each bush have died totaling maybe 50% of the whole lot. The area is on the south side of my house, there's lots of light. I feel the drainage is good, and all of the surrounding plants are doing great. I'm not sure how to rectify the problem.

Title: How to Grow and Care for Lungwort
rejuvenate with fresh growth. you can also prune off leaves that degrade from especially hot or dry weather, as needed. some gardeners choose to simply mow off the tops of the plants as they go dormant during the dry, hot, midsummer period. if kept well - watered, the plants will rejuvenate as the weather cools. propagating lungwort most modern pulmonaria varieties are hybrids that are not generally propagated from seeds. instead, propagation is best accomplished by root division : after a mature plant is done flowering, carefully dig up the entire root ball while keeping the roots intact. wash off the dirt to expose the roots. gently pull apart the clump with your fingers, separating the roots into pieces. discard woody sections. replant the divisions and water them in thoroughly. potting and repotting lungwort growing lungwort in pots or containers is not worth the trouble. the plants will not perform as well as they would in a moist, shady garden location. common pests & plant diseases lungworts don ’ t have any notable pest or disease problems. but they can be prone to powdery mildew and slug damage, which results in abnormal and damaged foliage. powdery mildew is not generally fatal, but it can be treated with a spray fungicide. overwintering lungwort is best covered with mulch after the ground freezes in the winter. this will moderate freeze - thaw cycles and ensure that roots survive the winter. this is especially necessary in zones 3 and 4, where winters can be quite bitter with rapid cycles between temperature extremes. how to get lungwort to bloom lungwort is grown primarily for its foliage but has attractive flowers. to get lungwort to bloom, provide the right amount of sun and shade, keep the soil consistently moist, and maintain proper soil ph levels. bloom months lungwort blooms towards the end of winter to early spring. how long does lungwort take to bloom? lungwort blooms quickly once it flowers, but flowers fade quickly, leading to the beautiful foliage the plant is known for. what do lungwort flowers look and smell like? lungwort's flowers are bell - or funnel - shaped with five petals, usually starting out pinkish in color then maturing to a violet blue. flower color, however, can vary by species and cultivar. lungwort has a sweet, watery smell that many compare to a cucumber. how to encourage more blooms removing dead leaves and growth can not only make lungwort more visually appealing, but also it can prolong the bloom period. common problems with lungwort lungwort needs fairly precise conditions to flourish, but if those are provided, they are easy to grow and will give you few problems. however, gardeners who are new to this plant are sometimes troubled by the way it dies back when the weather turns hot and dry in midsummer. this is fairly natural with this plant and not a cause for concern. cutting back the plants and keeping them moist ( but not soggy ) usually encourages them to return as hot summer weather begins to cool in the fall. faq how did lungwort get its name? lungwort ( pulmonaria spp. ) got its common name because its leaves are shaped like lungs, and the plant was indeed once used medicinally to treat lung ailments.

User > Killing grass: I'm chair of the Landscape Committee for my townhome association and we are trying to replace the grass in our bullnoses between garages with native grasses and plants. We covered the areas with clear plastic in April but it doesn't seem to be killing off any grass. We are considering using a herbicide however, several members of the committee are concerned about the trees in the bullnoses. All of the bullnoses have a small tree, mostly crab apples but also a serviceberry. The crabs are original to the property so they were planted in 2004-5 but the serviceberries are only a few years old. Can we safely use a herbicide to kill the grass without harming our trees?

User > Lawn/grass help needed. I live in NW Rochester, and attached is a picture of my front lawn. I know this damage is not from my dog, as I have other small spots that are from him. Is this from it getting frozen in winter, and is it 100% dead? Will it turn green from just water and fertilizer, or what else would it need? I did add some seeds and fertilizer about 10 days ago but haven’t seen much happening?

User: Is this a female Osoberry flower? I planted an Osoberry (Indian plum) in the garden, and I assumed it would be male and I'd need to find a female (to produce fruit), but as the buds are just starting to flower, the info I find online compared to mine make me think I might have lucked out and have a female plant?! Can anyone confirm who's familiar with these flowers? I'm attaching a photo.

User > Juniper branches are dying. A month ago I planted a hedge with Juniperus Cinensis Blue Point bushes. They are about 4.5 ft tall and some of them were root bound so I pulled the roots apart when I planted them. The branches on many of them are starting to die. Most of the dead branches are on the bottom of the plant but some are in the middle. I have clay soil so I did amend with compost. I have not watered too much because the soil holds moisture. What do I do?

User: What is the white fluff on apple tree branches? Our apple tree has sections of white fluff along many of its branches. In some places it is quite concentrated; in other places it is scarce but evident. The fluff seems to be entirely along sections of branch that were scored and split by last year's cicadas. We did not cover this tree and it was infested. The tree is 10-12 yrs old, planted in full sun and is otherwise healthy. It is not planted in a spot that skews wet or dry; it's on flat ground in front of our house. What is it?

intervention are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. they tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. this feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. one of the most noticeable signs of an aphid infestation is apple tree leaves turning yellow, which indicates that the tree is under stress from the loss of nutrients. left unchecked, aphids can weaken your apple tree, making it more susceptible to other diseases and pests. regular monitoring and natural control methods can help prevent serious damage. apple - leaf blister mites apple - leaf blister mites are tiny pests that cause noticeable red or yellow blisters on the leaves of your apple tree. while the damage is mostly cosmetic, a severe infestation can weaken the tree over time. this weakening can result in reduced fruit production as the tree's energy is diverted toward recovering from the mite damage. apple - leaf blister mites are particularly problematic in young trees or in cases where the infestation goes untreated. regular inspection of leaves for blistering can help catch the problem early, ensuring that your tree stays healthy and productive. speckled green fruitworm speckled green fruitworms are caterpillars that feed on apple tree leaves and fruit. if you notice chunks missing from your apples, you may have these critters on your hands. how to keep apple tree pests at bay keeping apple tree pests at bay is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tree. prevention is always easier than dealing with a full - blown infestation. here are some effective natural strategies to protect your apple trees : - prune regularly : remove damaged or dead branches where pests may hide or lay eggs. this keeps your tree healthy and makes it harder for pests to establish themselves. - encourage beneficial insects : ladybugs and lacewings prey on harmful pests like aphids. introducing or attracting these beneficial insects to your garden can naturally control pest populations. - use organic treatments : spray neem oil or horticultural soap on your tree to suffocate and repel pests. these organic solutions are effective without harming beneficial insects or the environment. - net your apple trees : netting is an excellent organic method to prevent pests, such as apple maggot flies, from laying eggs on your apples. it is a simple but highly effective way to safeguard your fruit. - keep the area clean : clear away fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris around the tree. this prevents pests from using the ground as a breeding site and helps reduce the chances of reinfestation. these methods will help keep your apple tree healthy and free from common pests. organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees? when it comes to pest control for your apple trees, there are two primary options : organic and chemical. our findings show that while chemical treatments can be highly effective at quickly eliminating pests, they come with drawbacks, such as potentially harming beneficial insects and negatively impacting the environment. organic methods, such as using neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introducing natural predators, offer a safer, more environmentally sustainable approach. these methods work well for most situations, though they may require more frequent application. in cases of severe infestations, chemical treatments may be necessary to prevent significant damage to your trees. ultimately, it's about finding the right balance between protecting your apple trees and aligning with your gardening values. dealing with apple tree pests can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies in place, your apple trees will remain healthy and productive for years to come. from tackling apple tree rust treatment to addressing orange spots on apple tree leaves, knowing how to manage pests is crucial for a thriving harvest. if you're looking for the best disease resistant apple trees or more tips on how to keep bugs off apple trees naturally, raintree nursery has a wide selection of varieties and expert resources to guide you. as trusted experts in home gardening, we're committed to helping you grow the healthiest, most productive apple trees possible. visit raintree nursery today to explore our options and get started on your journey to successful apple growing! if you want to learn more, why not check out this article below : - will apples ripen off the tree - pruning apple trees - how long does it take for an apple tree to grow?

Title: Apple Tree Pests: Identification and Treatment — Raintree Nursery
if you're growing apple trees in your home garden, dealing with apple tree pests might already be on your radar. these pests can be a real challenge, especially for those new to apple tree care. as trusted experts, we know that these unwelcome visitors are common, and if not properly managed, they can impact your tree's health and fruit production. so, if you're looking for reliable ways to protect your apple trees, you've come to the right place. in this article, we'll dive deeper into identifying apple tree pests, understanding the damage they cause, and exploring natural methods to protect your trees. if you're ready to take control of your apple tree's health and enjoy a thriving harvest, continue reading to learn more. what this article covers : - common apple tree pests - how to keep apple tree pests at bay - organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees? common apple tree pests pests can affect your apple tree in a variety of ways, from damaging leaves to ruining fruit. here are some of the most frequent culprits : the apple maggot fly is one of the most common and damaging pests that apple growers face, often even more so than the codling moth. the adult fly lays its eggs beneath the skin of the apple, and when the larvae hatch, they tunnel through the fruit, creating winding brown trails. this damage can cause the fruit to become deformed, rot, and drop prematurely. our findings show that the apple maggot fly can destroy a large portion of your harvest if not properly managed. netting apple trees is one of the most effective organic pest control methods to prevent apple maggot flies from laying eggs on your fruit. early detection and intervention are key to minimizing damage from these pests. codling moths are among the most damaging apple tree pests that home growers encounter. the adult moths lay eggs on apples, and once the larvae hatch, they burrow into the fruit. this creates unsightly brown trails inside the apples, often leading to rotting and early fruit drop. our findings show that the codling moth larvae can destroy large portions of your crop if left untreated. if you've ever cut into an apple and found a worm inside, it's almost certainly due to a codling moth infestation. preventing these pests early in the season with proper monitoring and treatment is essential for maintaining healthy fruit. spider mites are tiny pests that can cause significant damage to your apple tree if not properly managed. if you spot brown spots on apple tree leaves or a dusty appearance on the foliage, it's often a sign of spider mite activity. these pests feed by sucking the sap from the leaves, weakening your tree over time and reducing its ability to produce healthy fruit. spider mites spread quickly, especially in hot and dry conditions, which can lead to a more widespread infestation if left untreated. regular monitoring and early intervention are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. they tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. this feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. one of the most noticeable signs of an aphid infestation is apple tree leaves turning yellow, which indicates that the tree is under stress from the loss of nutrients. left unchecked, aphids can weaken your apple tree, making it more susceptible to other diseases and pests. regular monitoring and natural control methods can help prevent serious damage. apple - leaf blister mites apple - leaf blister mites are tiny pests that cause noticeable red or yellow blisters on the leaves of your apple tree. while the damage is mostly cosmetic, a severe infestation can weaken the tree over time. this weakening can result in reduced fruit production as the tree's energy is diverted toward recovering from the mite damage. apple - leaf blister mites are particularly problematic in young trees or in cases where the infestation goes untreated. regular inspection of leaves for blistering can help catch the problem early, ensuring that your tree stays healthy and productive. speckled green fruitworm speckled green fruitworms are caterpillars that feed on apple tree leaves and fruit. if you notice chunks missing from your apples, you may have these critters on your hands. how to keep apple tree pests at bay keeping apple tree pests at bay is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tree. prevention is always easier than dealing with a full - blown infestation. here are some effective natural strategies to protect your apple trees : - prune regularly : remove damaged or dead branches where pests may hide or lay eggs. this keeps your tree healthy and makes it harder for pests to establish themselves. - encourage beneficial insects : ladybugs and lacewings prey on harmful pests like aphids. introducing or attracting these beneficial insects to your garden can naturally control pest populations. - use organic treatments : spray neem oil or horticultural soap on your tree to suffocate and repel pests. these organic solutions are effective without harming beneficial insects or the environment. - net your apple trees : netting is an excellent organic method to prevent pests, such as apple maggot flies, from laying eggs on your apples. it is a simple but highly effective way to safeguard your fruit. - keep the area clean : clear away fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris around the tree. this prevents pests from using the ground as a breeding site and helps reduce the chances of reinfestation. these methods will help keep your apple tree healthy and free from common pests. organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees?

Title: How to Identify and Treat Maple Bark Diseases and Afflictions
. in general, lichens from each group appear in various sizes and shapes, and tree - dwelling types as a whole tend to sport shades of pale blue or green. they ’ re commonly found on the bark of trees, with different species finding certain bark textures easier to adhere to than others. since lichens prefer full sun exposure, health issues resulting in any degree of defoliation for the tree will increase a lichen ’ s chances of surviving and thriving on your maple. therefore, if lichen elimination for aesthetics is the goal, it ’ s essential to try to prevent or resolve any infections, infestations, or poor cultivation practices that could compromise the leaves. unfortunately, lichens can also grow on healthy specimens and there aren ’ t any chemical treatments available that will solely target the lichen. furthermore, removal by hand will result in excessive damage to the trunk. but in general, they can be indicative of an unhealthy tree that ’ s vulnerable to disease or insects, and they can also attract large animals such as deer or caribou that like to feed on lichens. the resources that these organisms take from the tree are miniscule, but definitely warrant action for those who want to cultivate a tree that ’ s entirely free of stress. thankfully, a clump or two of lichen isn ’ t the most unaesthetic thing that could happen to the trunk of your maple tree. plus, a lichen ’ s presence is often indicative of good air quality! tiny organisms and exposures to extreme temperatures aren ’ t the only stressors that can damage a maple tree ’ s bark. lightning strikes, severe winds, animal damage, and even climbing children can do a number on the trunk and branches of an acer via physical damage. if the damage is to a branch, you ’ ll need to prune it off with a sterilized tool such as a saw or a pair of loppers. make the cut below a node or just above the branch collar, depending on whether the branch is salvageable or not. in the case of bark damage, trim away any ragged or torn pieces so that healing sans infection can begin. sapstreak is a disease which primarily afflicts sugar maple trees, so i ’ m especially passionate about this one. any sickness that could leave my waffles unsweetened demands my full attention. caused by the fungus ceratocystis virescens, sapstreak is a fatal disease which enters wounds in a sugar maple ’ s trunk or root system. typically, this mostly affects the cut logs or stumps of a. saccharum trees planted as a part of a sugar maple stand – although the disease can affect living trees, as well. this disease has the potential to wipe out large maple syrup operations, yet another threat to a sweet and syrup - glazed breakfast. the sticky c. virescens spores that cause sapstreak disease are vectored by insects such as sap beetles and fruit flies that carry the spores from plant to plant – all of which occurs mostly during the summer months. symptoms include a streaked and radiating stain in the trunk and roots, along with stunted leaf growth and gradual branch dieback. the progression of symptoms will eventually culminate in the plant ’ s death three to four years after the onset of infection. because the stain is internal, the disease has a high potential of going unnoticed until after the tree dies. prevention is all you can do for your maples when it comes to sapstreak, as there is no known cure. avoid inflicting wounds to the trunk and roots, and make sure to avoid summertime logging, as that ’ s a prime time for this disease to spread. remove trees as they become infected to prevent further spread throughout the grove or landscape. 7. sooty bark disease like sapstreak, sooty bark disease is caused by a fungal pathogen – cryptostroma corticale, to be exact. the fungus makes its way into a maple ’ s heartwood – the dense, nonliving wood at the core of a tree ’ s sapwood – after infiltrating and killing smaller branches. once it reaches the core of the tree, it spreads up and down the trunk, eventually traveling outwards to the bark. and when it has arrived, the disease blisters and kills the bark, along with producing dark, sooty - looking, spore - producing masses directly under the bark, hence the name. additional symptoms include dead twigs that often appear on a single side of the tree, trunk cankers, leaf wilt, soft rot, and the eventual death of infected maples. it ’ s important to scout out potential planting spots for signs of this disease such as black mold underneath nearby trees – it could save you a lot of hassle. if sooty bark disease prevention is a high - priority goal of yours, avoid pruning healthy trees during dry summer conditions, since sunburned bark is a prime entry point for c. corticale. if you find an infected tree, remove it and burn it, making sure to keep all parts covered during any necessary transportation from one area of the landscape to another. the best time to do this is during the rainy months, as this disease spreads the most in hot and dry weather conditions. as a pale white dude in missouri who loves being outside, i know a thing or two about damage from the sun. with every sunburn i receive, it feels as if my genetics are screaming at me to seek shelter, or refrain from going outside unless it ’ s gray and cloudy out. all of this to say : whenever i see a tree with sunscald, i truly feel for it. sunscald occurs when high temperatures and harsh sun exposure cause severe bark damage. it ’ s commonly seen on the trunks of young trees that have yet to develop enough durability to withstand the sun ’ s rays. early symptoms include reddish - brown, canker - esque discoloration and slight vertical cracks in the bark. damaged areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic

User > Several lower leaves on my zinnia plants have developed discolored, blotchy appearances. It may be some kind of bacteria. The zinnias, always planted in this bed on the outside of my community garden plot, are amended every year with leaf grow or mulched garden leaves. The zinnia seeds were from various seed companies and planted on May 23. It’s too early for powdery mildew, and this affliction doesn’t resemble that. Is there some kind of fungicide I might try for the discolored zinnia leaves? Shall I pull off and discard the lower leaves? The plants haven’t bloomed yet?

- based fungicides, horticultural oil with baking soda, sulfur, myclobutanil, propiconazole, tebuconazole, and thiophanate methyl. the last four listed are the most effective for powdery mildew control. under conditions of disease development, spray plants weekly. always spray fungicides in the late evening to reduce the impact on pollinating insects. see table 1 for examples of brands and products. follow label directions for mixing and use. for more information on powdery mildew and control, see hgic 2049, powdery mildew. alternaria leaf spot : the fungus alternaria zinnia causes a leaf spot on zinnias that starts as small, dark reddish, circular spots that rapidly expand and become irregularly shaped with grayish - white centers. as the spots become larger, they may develop dark concentric rings in the centers. the center of these leaf spots may eventually tear, fall out, and leave behind holes in the leaves. serious infections cause the leaves to turn brown quickly and shrivel. infections occur not only on foliage but also on ray flowers, which will wither and produce lesions on stems, which often become girdled and finally wilt. seed from infected plants can spread this leaf spot disease. spray plants following rainy periods, as rainy conditions increase disease occurrence and spread. the better fungicides to control alternaria leaf spot are chlorothalonil, copper fungicides, and mancozeb. see table 1 for examples of brands and products containing these fungicides. follow label directions for mixing and use. do not use thiophanate methyl fungicides, as these are ineffective. always spray flowering ornamentals in the late evening. bacterial leaf spot : xanthomonas campestris pv. zinniae is the causal agent of bacterial leaf spot of zinnias, and the symptoms of infection are purplish spots that usually remain small, but they become angular in shape. spots may develop a yellow halo. spray plants weekly with a copper fungicide following periods of leaf wetness to reduce disease incidence, as copper fungicides are also effective against many bacterial diseases. see table 1 for examples of brands and products containing copper. follow label directions for mixing and use. always spray plants in bloom during the late evening. seed collected from infected plants may spread bacterial leaf spot. cercospora leaf spot : this fungal leaf spot, caused by cercospora zinniae, occurs less commonly than alternaria leaf spot, powdery mildew, or bacterial leaf spot, but it can be just as damaging. cercospora leaf spots on foliage are typically reddish - purple, small, and round with light gray to almost white centers. these spots may coalesce ( run together ), and heavily infected leaves usually die. spray as needed following rainy periods with chlorothalonil, copper fungicides, or mancozeb. see table 1 for examples of brands and products with these fungicides and follow label directions for mixing and use. always spray flowering ornamentals in the late evening. aster yellows : aster yellows is caused by a phytoplasma and is similar to a bacterium. it is carried by aster leafhoppers ( macrosteles quadrilineatus ), which are insects that feed on the sap of the plants. as they feed, they inject the phytoplasma into the vascular system of the zinnia and cause the developing flowers to become deformed. there is no control method once the flowers have been infected, and plants with symptoms should be promptly removed and discarded in the trash. fortunately, aster yellows is not extremely common. table 1. fungicide & insecticide products for disease & pest control on zinnias pesticides are updated annually. last updates were done 10 / 24 by n. jordan franklin. originally published 11 / 20

insect pest prevention & control zinnias are excellent sources of pollen and nectar for many beneficial insects ; therefore, it is not recommended that insecticides, other than insecticidal soap, be used to control damaging mite and insect pests. rather than depending exclusively on pesticides, proper culture ( soil preparation, fertilizers, irrigation, mulch, optimum plant spacing, and adequate sunlight ) is better for preventing insect and disease problems. zinnias have few insect pests, but aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies may damage plants, especially during hot, dry weather. aphids and spider mites can be hosed off the plants with a strong stream of water. since spider mites thrive in hot, dry weather, reducing drought stress with supplemental irrigation will help prevent an infestation. spray applications of insecticidal soap may be applied to control spider mites, aphids, and whiteflies, but always spray flowering plants in the late evening to prevent harming beneficial insects or hummingbirds. insecticidal soap sprays must be directed at the lower leaf surfaces where many pests feed. see table 1 for examples of insecticidal soap products. for more information about the use of insecticidal soap, see hgic 2771, insecticidal soaps for garden pest control. disease prevention & control most diseases may be prevented when zinnias are watered and cared for properly. zinnias grow best in full sun all day ; however, they may be more prone to leaf spot diseases in partial shade. it is important to keep the foliage dry to discourage bacterial and fungal diseases. therefore, it is best to always water near the base of the plants. if overhead watering is used, irrigate during the early morning hours to allow the leaves to dry quickly in the morning sunlight. disease incidence is greater if plants are watered in the late afternoon or evening, thus causing the leaves to stay wet longer. these conditions provide the perfect environment for both bacterial and fungal disease development. alternate using zinnias with different bedding plant species for a year or two to reduce disease incidence. prompt removal of any highly pest - infested or disease - infected plants will reduce pest and disease spread. at the end of the growing season, remove all plant debris to reduce the carry - over of fungal disease inoculum ( the pathogen responsible for the infection ). this will lessen or delay the occurrence of diseases the following year. infected seed may also be a source of these diseases ; therefore, do not save seed for sowing the next year if there has been an outbreak of leaf spot diseases. powdery mildew : powdery mildew is a fungal disease ( golovinomyces cichoracearum ) that appears primarily on plant foliage but may also infect flowers and stems. this disease appears as a grayish - white, powdery coating on zinnias. practice good cultural methods. however, if fungicides are required, there are several that are very effective. these include copper - based fungicides, horticultural oil with baking soda, sulfur, myclobutanil, propiconazole, tebuconazole, and thiophanate methyl. the last four listed are the most effective for powdery mildew control. under conditions of disease development, spray plants weekly. always spray fungicides in the late evening to reduce the impact on pollinating"

User > Can we ameliorate the soil in the area where we had a large, diseased white spruce tree removed (and stump ground) in our front yard a couple years ago, so that shrubs like azaleas can thrive? We are having trouble getting azaleas to grow there now and suspect it may be caused by acidic soil from the large amount of needles the tree shed over the previous decades. The area is shaded by a large maple tree in the boulevard and by an ash tree in the neighbor's yard, and the azaleas were planted last summer. We noticed some rabbit damage to the azaleas over the winter too. Also in that area, we planted a couple of serviceberry plants and they and the azaleas are alive but neither are thriving. Do we need to fertilize? We water there when needed, the same amount we do on the other side of the yard where dogwoods, spirea, and hydrangeas are doing well. Any other suggestions?

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as lilac, forsythia, and spirea, can be pruned in this manner. pruning overgrown hedges is an ongoing process that requires regular maintenance. the key to maintaining a healthy, attractive hedge is to prune it regularly, especially after new growth appears. proper pruning will help to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. pruning overgrown hedges is an important part of maintaining a beautiful and healthy landscape.

User > Can you tell me what type of destructive caterpillar this is? It consumed every leaf on this one bush in my yard. It drops to the ground with a single thread it spins. It can make a crude web if left alone. It's about 0.75 inches long and is a dull greenish white color. There are thousands of them right now. Is there something I can spray on the bush to prevent further attacks of this insect?

##y antennae. the tent caterpillar larvae grow to 2 ” long or more. they ’ re dark with yellow tufts and a white stripe running down their back. female moths lay eggs in shiny, dark - brown masses that encircle small branches, where they overwinter. in spring, the eggs hatch and the caterpillar larvae begin defoliating leaves on the host tree. after a month or so, the larvae mature and crawl down to the ground to find a sheltered place to make their white cocoons. the pupae develop in a matter of weeks and emerge as adult moths to mate and lay eggs for the following year ’ s generation. eastern tent caterpillar the best way to reduce next year ’ s population is to remove and destroy egg masses in fall and winter. the pests also have several natural predators, including many bird species, which eat the caterpillar larvae during daylight hours. if those measures aren ’ t enough, you can spray caterpillar larvae with pesticides. this should be done as early in spring as possible when the larvae are small. it may be difficult to spray effectively when little foliage has emerged, but direct spraying will kill the larvae. as with fall webworm, spraying the webs will not reach the larvae sheltering inside. apply residual, foliar insecticide sprays to leaves and twigs during the day when caterpillars are out eating leaves and reapply it regularly. if you ’ re spraying fruit trees, only use insecticides designed for fruiting trees. do not burn webs! fire and flames can seriously damage your trees. the spongy moth ( lymantria dispar dispar ) is a major pest of hardwood trees in northern virginia, as larvae rapidly defoliate trees. the caterpillars are an inch or more in length, black or brown, with spots along their backs and tufts of bristle -

eating caterpillar. here in northern virginia, we have three common types of caterpillar that can defoliate trees – - eastern tent caterpillar - spongy moth ( f. k. a. gypsy moth ) caterpillar learn more about these leaf - eating caterpillars and how integrated pest management can protect your trees. fall webworm ( hyphantria cunea ) is a native virginia caterpillar that spins webs over a tree ’ s terminal ( branch - end ) leaves to make a home and eat the enclosed leaves. the adult moths are white, with dark patches and feathery antennae. the larvae ( caterpillars ) are about an inch long and white, yellow or green. the female moth lays eggs in spring and early summer on the underside of leaves, and those eggs hatch within two weeks. it ’ s these newly - hatched caterpillars that damage your trees. toward the end of summer, the larvae pupate in the soil and leaf litter around the base of the host tree and overwinter there. in the spring, they emerge as moths. after hatching in mid or late summer, the caterpillar larvae begin to defoliate trees ( plan an inspection for damage as part of your summer tree care checklist ). the caterpillars spin protective webs on the end of tree branches. as they grow, they enlarge their webs to include more and more leaves. inside the webs, the larvae eat all but the tough midribs and veins of leaves. despite the disfiguring appearance of the webs, webworm is not considered a devastating insect pest in northern virginia, because : - foliar damage is done in late summer - affected trees generally recover from defoliation - webworm has many predators, including wasps and birds, that help control annual populations among the webworm ’ s preferred virginia tree species are : - pecans and hickories ( carya ) however, up to 100 tree species are used as hosts by the webworm caterpillars. controlling fall webworm controlling webworm can be done by spraying insecticide on leaves near the expanding perimeter of a web. spraying the webs directly is not effective, as the spun layers protect the larvae inside. if the branches of your trees that have webworm infestation are within reach, pruning off and destroying the branches and webs is an effective way to control their populations. large trees cannot be effectively sprayed or pruned from ground level, so homeowners should have tree care professionals perform this work. eastern tent caterpillar fall webworm is often confused with the eastern tent caterpillar ( malacosoma americanum ) because larvae of both insects build protective webs. however, the insects are different in appearance and habit. adult tent caterpillar moths are light brown with white stripes and feathery antennae. the tent caterpillar larvae grow to 2 ” long or more. they ’ re dark with yellow tufts and a white stripe running down their back. female moths lay eggs in shiny, dark - brown masses that encircle small branches, where they overwinter. in spring, the eggs hatch and the caterpillar larvae begin defoliating leaves on the host tree. after a month or so, the larvae mature and crawl down to the ground to find a sheltered place to make their white cocoons. the pupae develop in a matter of weeks and emerge as adult moths to mate and lay eggs for the following year ’ s generation. eastern tent caterpillar the best way to reduce next year ’ s population is to remove and destroy egg masses in fall and winter. the pests also have several natural predators, including many bird species, which eat the caterpillar larvae during daylight hours. if those measures aren ’ t enough, you can spray caterpillar larvae with pesticides. this should be done as early in spring as possible when the larvae are small. it may be difficult to spray effectively when little foliage has emerged, but direct spraying will kill the larvae. as with fall webworm, spraying the webs will not reach the larvae sheltering inside. apply residual, foliar insecticide sprays to leaves and twigs during the day when caterpillars are out eating leaves and reapply it regularly. if you ’ re spraying fruit trees, only use insecticides designed for fruiting trees. do not burn webs! fire and flames can seriously damage your trees. the spongy moth ( lymantria dispar dispar ) is a major pest of hardwood trees in northern virginia, as larvae rapidly defoliate trees. the caterpillars are an inch or more in length, black or brown, with spots along their backs and tufts of bristle -

eating caterpillar. here in northern virginia, we have three common types of caterpillar that can defoliate trees – - eastern tent caterpillar - spongy moth ( f. k. a. gypsy moth ) caterpillar learn more about these leaf - eating caterpillars and how integrated pest management can protect your trees. fall webworm ( hyphantria cunea ) is a native virginia caterpillar that spins webs over a tree ’ s terminal ( branch - end ) leaves to make a home and eat the enclosed leaves. the adult moths are white, with dark patches and feathery antennae. the larvae ( caterpillars ) are about an inch long and white, yellow or green. the female moth lays eggs in spring and early summer on the underside of leaves, and those eggs hatch within two weeks. it ’ s these newly - hatched caterpillars that damage your trees. toward the end of summer, the larvae pupate in the soil and leaf litter around the base of the host tree and overwinter there. in the spring, they emerge as moths. after hatching in mid or late summer, the caterpillar larvae begin to defoliate trees ( plan an inspection for damage as part of your summer tree care checklist ). the caterpillars spin protective webs on the end of tree branches. as they grow, they enlarge their webs to include more and more leaves. inside the webs, the larvae eat all but the tough midribs and veins of leaves. despite the disfiguring appearance of the webs, webworm is not considered a devastating insect pest in northern virginia, because : - foliar damage is done in late summer - affected trees generally recover from defoliation - webworm has many predators, including wasps and birds, that help control annual populations among the webworm ’ s preferred virginia tree species are : - pecans and hickories ( carya ) however, up to 100 tree species are used as hosts by the webworm caterpillars. controlling fall webworm controlling webworm can be done by spraying insecticide on leaves near the expanding perimeter of a web. spraying the webs directly is not effective, as the spun layers protect the larvae inside. if the branches of your trees that have webworm infestation are within reach, pruning off and destroying the branches and webs is an effective way to control their populations. large trees cannot be effectively sprayed or pruned from ground level, so homeowners should have tree care professionals perform this work. eastern tent caterpillar fall webworm is often confused with the eastern tent caterpillar ( malacosoma americanum ) because larvae of both insects build protective webs. however, the insects are different in appearance and habit. adult tent caterpillar moths are light brown with white stripes and feathery antennae. the tent caterpillar larvae grow to 2 ” long or more. they ’ re dark with yellow tufts and a white stripe running down their back. female moths lay eggs in shiny, dark - brown masses that encircle small branches, where they overwinter. in spring, the eggs hatch and the caterpillar larvae begin defoliating leaves on the host tree. after a month or so, the larvae mature and crawl down to the ground to find a sheltered place to make their white cocoons. the pupae develop in a matter of weeks and emerge as adult moths to mate and lay eggs for the following year ’ s generation. eastern tent caterpillar the best way to reduce next year ’ s population is to remove and destroy egg masses in fall and winter. the pests also have several natural predators, including many bird species, which eat the caterpillar larvae during daylight hours. if those measures aren ’ t enough, you can spray caterpillar larvae with pesticides. this should be done as early in spring as possible when the larvae are small. it may be difficult to spray effectively when little foliage has emerged, but direct spraying will kill the larvae. as with fall webworm, spraying the webs will not reach the larvae sheltering inside. apply residual, foliar insecticide sprays to leaves and twigs during the day when caterpillars are out eating leaves and reapply it regularly. if you ’ re spraying fruit trees, only use insecticides designed for fruiting trees. do not burn webs! fire and flames can seriously damage your trees. the spongy moth ( lymantria dispar dispar ) is a major pest of hardwood trees in northern virginia, as larvae rapidly defoliate trees. the caterpillars are an inch or more in length, black or brown, with spots along their backs and tufts of bristle - like hairs. female moths have white wings with black markings, and are flightless. male moths have darker, brownish wings with black markings, feather - like antennae, and can fly. spongy moth egg masses are tan, and covered with wing scales from the adult female moth. the masses hold hundreds of eggs, and can be found on outdoor surfaces of all kinds. moving items that hold spongy moth eggs is one way the insect is spread, so inspecting all items is vital to prevent the insect ’ s spread. adult moths in emerge in early summer, after pupating. the adult moths mate in summer, and female moths lay eggs that will overwinter, hatching the following spring. spongy moth larvae ( caterpillars ) hatch in spring, and voraciously defoliate trees as they go through their larval stages. while annual populations of spongy moth fluctuate, severe or repeated defoliation of garden and forest trees can kill large numbers of trees. its preferred species is oak ( quercus ), but spongy moth caterpillars feed on hundreds of tree species, including : -

eating caterpillar. here in northern virginia, we have three common types of caterpillar that can defoliate trees – - eastern tent caterpillar - spongy moth ( f. k. a. gypsy moth ) caterpillar learn more about these leaf - eating caterpillars and how integrated pest management can protect your trees. fall webworm ( hyphantria cunea ) is a native virginia caterpillar that spins webs over a tree ’ s terminal ( branch - end ) leaves to make a home and eat the enclosed leaves. the adult moths are white, with dark patches and feathery antennae. the larvae ( caterpillars ) are about an inch long and white, yellow or green. the female moth lays eggs in spring and early summer on the underside of leaves, and those eggs hatch within two weeks. it ’ s these newly - hatched caterpillars that damage your trees. toward the end of summer, the larvae pupate in the soil and leaf litter around the base of the host tree and overwinter there. in the spring, they emerge as moths. after hatching in mid or late summer, the caterpillar larvae begin to defoliate trees ( plan an inspection for damage as part of your summer tree care checklist ). the caterpillars spin protective webs on the end of tree branches. as they grow, they enlarge their webs to include more and more leaves. inside the webs, the larvae eat all but the tough midribs and veins of leaves. despite the disfiguring appearance of the webs, webworm is not considered a devastating insect pest in northern virginia, because : - foliar damage is done in late summer - affected trees generally recover from defoliation - webworm has many predators, including wasps and birds, that help control annual populations among the webworm ’ s preferred virginia tree species are : - pecans and hickories ( carya ) however, up to 100 tree species are used as hosts by the webworm caterpillars. controlling fall webworm controlling webworm can be done by spraying insecticide on leaves near the expanding perimeter of a web. spraying the webs directly is not effective, as the spun layers protect the larvae inside. if the branches of your trees that have webworm infestation are within reach, pruning off and destroying the branches and webs is an effective way to control their populations. large trees cannot be effectively sprayed or pruned from ground level, so homeowners should have tree care professionals perform this work. eastern tent caterpillar fall webworm is often confused with the eastern tent caterpillar ( malacosoma americanum ) because larvae of both insects build protective webs. however, the insects are different in appearance and habit. adult tent caterpillar moths are light brown with white stripes and feathery antennae. the tent caterpillar larvae grow to 2 ” long or more. they ’ re dark with yellow tufts and a white stripe running down their back. female moths lay eggs in shiny, dark - brown masses that encircle small branches, where they overwinter. in spring, the eggs hatch and the caterpillar larvae begin defoliating leaves on the host tree. after a month or so, the larvae mature and crawl down to the ground to find a sheltered place to make their white cocoons. the pupae develop in a matter of weeks and emerge as adult moths to mate and lay eggs for the following year ’ s generation. eastern tent caterpillar the best way to reduce next year ’ s population is to remove and destroy egg masses in fall and winter. the pests also have several natural predators, including many bird species, which eat the caterpillar larvae during daylight hours. if those measures aren ’ t enough, you can spray caterpillar larvae with pesticides. this should be done as early in spring as possible when the larvae are small. it may be difficult to spray effectively when little foliage has emerged, but direct spraying will kill the larvae. as with fall webworm, spraying the webs will not reach the larvae sheltering inside. apply residual, foliar insecticide sprays to leaves and twigs during the day when caterpillars are out eating leaves and reapply it regularly. if you ’ re spraying fruit trees, only use insecticides designed for fruiting trees. do not burn webs! fire and flames can seriously damage your trees. the spongy moth ( lymantria dispar dispar ) is a major pest of hardwood trees in northern virginia, as larvae rapidly defoliate trees. the caterpillars are an inch or more in length, black or brown, with spots along their backs and tufts of bristle - like hairs. female moths have white wings with black markings, and are flightless. male moths have darker, brownish wings with black markings, feather - like antennae, and can fly. spongy moth egg masses are tan, and covered with wing scales from the adult female moth. the masses hold hundreds of eggs, and can be found on outdoor surfaces of all kinds. moving items that hold spongy moth eggs is one way the insect is spread, so inspecting all items is vital to prevent the insect ’ s spread. adult moths in emerge in early summer, after pupating. the adult moths mate in summer, and female moths lay eggs that will overwinter, hatching the following spring. spongy moth larvae ( caterpillars ) hatch in spring, and voraciously defoliate trees as they go through their larval stages. while annual populations of spongy moth fluctuate, severe or repeated defoliation of garden and forest trees can kill large numbers of trees. its preferred species is oak ( quercus ), but spongy moth caterpillars feed on hundreds of tree species, including : -

User > I'm trying to eradicate old orange daylilies from a very large hillside, about 200 x 18 ft, where I want to remove the patches of daylilies that have spread over many years. I aim to transform this area into a haven for native plants, many of which naturally thrive there already. I have replaced some daylilies with more natives. I've used Round Up twice last year and once early this spring but wish to avoid it now due to the native plants. I hope to eliminate these daylilies by the end of the summer to seed the area or plant more small plants in the fall. Though the photos aren't the best, you might notice how sickly these plants look. Mainly, I'm considering cutting off the remaining green/yellow leaves to expedite their demise. What do you think? I continue to dig them out gradually, as other methods like smothering aren't feasible here. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated!

daylily weed control : tips for controlling daylilies in the garden sign up for the gardening know how newsletter today and receive a free copy of our e - book \\\" how to grow delicious tomatoes \\\". you are now subscribed your newsletter sign - up was successful the orange flowers of the common orange daylily brighten up ditches and old farmsteads across the country, where they were once planted by fanciers in droves. these nineteenth century gardeners didn't realize how aggressively their orange flowers would grow, or that one day daylily weed control would be a serious pursuit. if you've got a daylily problem, you've come to the right place. read on for tips on controlling daylilies. are daylily plants invasive? common orange daylilies ( hemerocallis fulva ), also known as ditch lilies or tiger lilies, are extremely invasive and hard to kill once established, but unlike many garden favorites, these daylilies don't need special care to get established, or possibly any care whatsoever. they may spread from a stand started long ago, or from tubers pulled out of other gardens and tossed on the ground in your garden. many gardeners find their daylily is out of control and panic, but pulling them takes patience ; these are not your typical landscape plants. although orange daylilies are usually the problem plants, hybrid daylilies have the potential to run amok as well through self seeding, so take care if you replace your orange daylilies with these hybrids. installing a barrier well ahead of planting season and harvesting any seedpods that may develop on your hybrid daylilies can save lots of headaches down the line. when you're dealing with daylilies, you're working with something that behaves just like a perennial weed. they emerge from tubers in the soil and your control efforts must take this behavior into account to be successful. how to get rid of daylilies depending on the size of your daylily problem, you may be able to dig them out by hand and discard them in plastic bags. make sure to carefully comb the soil of all the little bits of root or tubers and tightly seal the bags you're using for disposal. these plants can easily grow back from sections of root ; improper disposal will create a headache for someone else. some gardeners have had good luck mowing down daylilies and then smothering them with thick layers of mulch. apply 4 to 6 inches ( 10 - 15 cm. ) over the daylily stand, but be prepared to fight with them through the season. like any perennial weed, the daylilies will continue to try to send new growth up through the mulch. you may need to apply more mulch if any green parts make it through your mulch barrier. adding a thick layer of newspaper and watering it well before installing the mulch will give the daylilies an even greater challenge. a systemic weed killer, applied carefully, can be used to destroy daylilies if they're not close to anything you'd prefer not to kill. this type of non - selective herbicide will destroy anything that it coats, including daylilies and your favorite rose bush, so wait for a calm, hot day to hit the daylily stand. coat the unwanted plants liberally, but don't allow the herbicide to drip onto the ground or nearby plants. it can take up to two weeks to see results, but if any daylilies still look healthy, respray them at this time. note : chemical control should only be used as a last resort, as organic approaches are safer and much more environmentally friendly. sign up for the gardening know how newsletter today and receive a free copy of our e - book \\\" how to grow delicious tomatoes \\\". kristi waterworth was a regular contributor to gardening know how for many years, answering countless queries on plant pests and diseases.

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses :
leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib.
leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature.
growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses.
vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species.
inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns.
seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets.
stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature.
root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons.
habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates.
to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities.
identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses
kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis )

growth habit : spreads primarily through stolons, forming a dense, carpet - like lawn.
vernation : folded.
inflorescence : a spike - like raceme containing several spikelets, often with a purplish hue.
color : medium to dark green.
fescue grass ( festuca spp. )
includes fine fescue and tall fescue
leaf blade : fine fescue has very narrow, needle - like leaves, while tall fescue has broader leaves with a prominent midrib. both have a slightly rough texture on the upper side.
growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps.
vernation : rolled ( fine fescue ) or folded ( tall fescue ).
inflorescence : fine fescue has a panicle - like inflorescence, while tall fescue has a more spike - like inflorescence. both contain small spikelets.
color : medium to dark green.
perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne )
leaf blade : narrow, with a shiny appearance on the upper side and a tapering tip. the leaf edges have a slightly rough texture.
growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps.
vernation : folded.
inflorescence : a spike - like inflorescence containing spikelets that are arranged alternately on a central stem.
color : bright green to dark green.
by observing these identifying characteristics, you can distinguish between the most common lawn grasses and better understand their growth habits and appearance. keep in mind that variations can occur within each species, and hybrid cultivars may exhibit unique features.

The Blue Spanish Fir is an outstanding evergreen specimen tree that is rarely available, despite being easy to grow, fast growing and stunningly beautiful. Although often overlooked for more common trees like blue spruce, this is a remarkable tree that is superior to any other blue-foliage evergreen. It grows 12 inches a year to become a tall conical tree of outstanding beauty. Everyone loves to see a blue-needle tree as a lawn specimen, and this one will grab attention like no other. The dense, bright silver-blue needles completely circle the stems, and the strong upright trunk carries the horizontal branches upwards to form a narrow conical tree that will soon be 30 feet tall and could eventually reach 80 feet. This grand specimen is ideal for larger gardens in milder parts of the country, and is unsurpassed in its beauty.
Plant your tree in a sunny location, in soil that is moist, well-drained and preferably slightly acidic, although this tree is tolerant of a wide range of garden soils. Once established it will tolerate moderate drought and it is free of pests or diseases. No special care or trimming is needed to grow a spectacular specimen of this elegantly beautiful tree, and we are proud to offer this rarely available award-winning plant to our customers.

User: Can you help with Plant ID of Meadowsweet? I bought this plant at a garden club plant sale. It was tagged as Meadowsweet. The foliage looks much lacier and delicate to me than the pictures I have seen online of Meadowsweet. Most of the foliage is basal growth though growth may be stunted as it is potted and has been for several years. It is blooming now and has tiny 1/4" 8 petaled white flowers on tall stalks. Not really noticing much of a scent. Your thoughts?

Title: Reddit - The heart of the internet
\\n\\nWhy is elevation so important to know about a plant species?\\n\\nI read a lot about plants, and for some plants it make sense to be specific about elevation for plants like Nepenthes, where there are bigger differences between highland vs lowland Nepenthes.\\n\\nBut reading information on plants, I find that a lot of researchers make very specific mentions of elevation for a LOT of plants. What makes it so particularly important to know about?\\n\\nDo I need to take elevation into account when caring for a plant?\\n\\nThe most I can think it really makes a difference is when talking about mountainous plants that grow with a different atmospheric makeup. But I find researchers are mentioning elevation for basically every plant.
Title: 17 Deer-Resistant Shade Plants That Will Brighten Up Your Garden
\\n\\n- style planting, or near water where the soil stays evenly moist. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 18 inches tall and 2 feet wide zones : 4 - 9 japanese painted fern thrives when planted in woodland gardens, near ponds and streams, along walkways, and in shaded patio gardens. 08 of 17 ligularia credit : peter krumhardt bold leaves and bright yellow flower spikes make ligularia a standout in shade. deer often pass it by, but this plant is picky about moisture. if the soil dries out — especially in summer heat — ligularia can wilt and look ragged. help it thrive by keeping the soil consistently moist and using mulch to slow evaporation. ligularia is a natural fit near water, such as along a shady stream bank, in a rain garden, or at the edge of a pond. growing conditions : grow in moisture - retentive soil and water deeply once a week size : to 4 feet tall and wide zones : 4 - 9 09 of 17 brunnera credit : john reed forsman also called siberian bugloss, brunnera ( brunnera macrophylla ) earns its keep in shade with heart - shaped leaves and sky - blue spring flowers. deer usually leave it alone. over time, brunnera forms fuller clumps and may also reseed, especially in moist, rich soil. if volunteer seedlings show up where you don ’ t want them, pull them while they ’ re small. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 18 inches tall and 30 inches wide zones : 3 - 8 show your love with these 6 heart - shape houseplants 10 of 17 oregon grape holly credit : denny schrock oregon grape holly ( mahonia aquifolium ) is a shade - loving shrub with thick, leathery leaves that have spiny edges — one reason deer tend to avoid it. in spring, it produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by blue - black berries later in the season. give this shrub room to spread slowly by runners if you ’ d like it to form a low, evergreen colony. growing conditions : slightly acidic, well - drained, moist soil size : to 3 feet tall and 5 feet wide zones : 5 - 8 if you want berries, you need to plant two or more shrubs. 11 of 17 skimmia credit : denny schrock skimmia ( skimmia spp. ) is a broadleaf evergreen that handles shade and brings spring fragrance, thanks to clusters of white flowers. on female plants, those blooms can be followed by showy red berries in fall. skimmia is also a deer - resistant shrub that works well in a foundation planting or as a low flowering hedge. for berries, plan on planting both male and female plants. the berries also attract songbirds. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist, well - drained soil size : to 4 feet tall and wide zones : 6 - 8 12 of 17 burkwood daphne credit : janet mesic - mackie daphne ( daphne x burkwoodii ) is a fragrant shrub that many gardeners consider a deer - resistant shade plant, especially in part shade. it produces clusters of pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by small red berries in fall ( which are toxic to mammals ). because daphne can be sensitive to poor drainage, plant it in well - drained soil and avoid low spots where water collects. use it in a perennial border or as a foundation plant along the north side of your house. growing conditions : well - drained soil in part shade size : to 4 feet tall and 2 - 3 feet wide zones : 5 - 7 13 of 17 bottlebrush buckeye credit : rob cardillo bottlebrush buckeye ( aesculus parviflora ) is a standout among flowering shrubs for shady landscapes, and deer usually leave it alone. in early summer, it ’ s covered in long spikes of white, nectar - rich flowers that can draw many pollinators, including butterflies. in fall, the foliage turns yellow. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 8 - 10 feet tall and 15 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 bottlebrush buckeye is toxic to humans and pets. 14 of 17 pachysandra credit : kritsada panichgul if deer are a problem, pachysandra ( pachyandra spp. ) is a classic shady groundcover. it spreads by underground stems and can fill in quickly, creating a dense mat of green or variegated leaves. in early spring, look for small white flowers tucked close to the foliage. because it spreads, pachysandra works best in areas where you want a continuous carpet — such as under trees or along the north side of a house. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : 4 - 6 inches tall and several feet wide zones : 4 - 9 15 of 17 epimedium credit : marty baldwin epimedium ( epimedium spp. ), also called barrenwort or bishop ’ s hat, is a top pick for dry shade and a reliable deer - resistant shade plant. it spreads slowly to form a low groundcover, with heart - shaped leaves that often have bronze or red tones in spring. airy flowers appear above the foliage in shades such as lavender, yellow, or white, depending on the variety. growing conditions : can tolerate dry or rocky soil size : to 18 inches tall and 3 feet wide zones : 4 - 8 16 of 17 foamflower credit : greg scheidemann foamflower ( tiarella cordifolia ) is a deer - resistant shade plant that brightens low - light borders with airy blooms. in late spring, it produces lots of small pink or white flowers. in fall, the foliage can shift to reddish bronze for a second season of color. use foamflower as a groundcover in a woodland setting or at the front of a shady border, where it can spread into a soft, leafy patch. growing conditions : rich, slightly moist soil size : to 1 foot tall and 3 feet wide zones : 3 - 9 17 of 17 windflower credit : andy lyons the deer - resistant shade plant windflower ( anemone sylvestris ) produces white or pink, daisy - like flowers on slender stems that sway in the breeze. it blooms in spring — often in april and may — and can brighten a lightly shaded border. windflower spreads slowly"

Title: Solomon’s Seal, Polygonatum spp. – Wisconsin Horticulture
...
 
Solomon’s seal is the common name for a number of species in the genus Polygonatum with an attractive architectural form. The rhizomes of various species have been used medicinally to treat various ailments or ground and baked into a type of bread, and the young shoots were eaten like asparagus. There are about 60 species in this group of herbaceous perennials in the lily family (Liliaceae) but only a few are commonly grown as ornamentals in the US, including both native and exotic species. The alternate leaves of solomon’s-seal are carried on long, upright to arching stems. The linear to broad, egg-shaped leaves zigzag their way up the unbranched stalks, each pair offset slightly along the stem. Most species have solid green leaves but some have variegated leaves. The leaves turn lemon yellow to brown in autumn and the stems wither away for the winter. The following spring a larger stem is produced from the rhizome. Only a single stem is produced annually from each rhizome section, but the rhizomes branch freely, so each plant will have multiple stems. The plants spread at a modest pace to form colonies of plants. The thick, fleshy, white, irregularly-shaped rhizomes bear rounded scars where previous year’s stems arose – and supposedly it is the resemblance of these scars to the two inverted triangles that were the symbol or seal of King Solomon that gave rise to the common name. These rhizomes can grow quite large and become woody. Polygonatums bloom with clusters of two or more small, bell-shaped flowers that dangle beneath the stems. The greenish-cream to white flowers arise at each node where the stems arch over and are therefore often hidden by the foliage. The flowers last for several weeks in the spring, then are followed by spherical, blue-black fruits resembling small grapes that are often eaten by birds. Solomon’s-seals prefer rich, moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade (where they will receive morning or dappled sunlight rather than afternoon sun) but they are quite adaptable to many situations, including those difficult dry shade spots near tree roots. It is best to allow fallen leaves from trees to remain where solomon’s-seal grows as a natural mulch and to form humus. They are very drought-tolerant once established, have few insect or disease problems, and are not favored by deer. These plants can be grown from seed but they are easiest to propagate by division. Rhizomes can be dug in the spring, just as the new growth emerges from the ground, or in fall, but plants typically don’t require division to remain vigorous. Entire clumps can be transplanted or larger rhizomes can be broken or cut into pieces to create multiple plants. Place the rhizomes horizontally a few inches deep and keep evenly moist until established. Solomon’s-seals are typically used as foliage plants (even though the flowers are nice, they are not particularly conspicuous), for their coarse texture and architectural presence. They combine well with bleeding hearts (Dicentra), ferns, hostas, lungworts (Pulmonaria), pigsqueak (Bergenia), wild ginger (Asarum canadensis and A. europaeum), astilbes and other shade-loving plants in shady borders or for naturalizing in a woodland garden where they provide contrast in texture and height with lower, mounding plants. They can be paired with daffodils and tulips, which will bloom before the solomon’s-seals are fully grown and later the plants will help hide the fading bulb foliage. The variegated types are great for brightening up dark areas. The native species may just show up in shady sites, the seeds deposited by birds. Some of the more commonly available species and cultivars include: P. biflorum, small or smooth solomon’s-seal, is native to eastern North America, from New England to Florida and west to Nebraska and Texas. As the common name suggests, the light green 4 inch long leaves are completely hairless. The plant grows 1-6 feet tall, with ½–¾ inch long white-or yellow-green flowers in late spring. It is hardy in zones 3-9. P. communatum, great solomon’s-seal, is now often considered just a larger form of P. biflorum, growing 5-6’ tall. P. cryptanthum, a Japanese species, grows about a foot tall and has a pair of green bracts that hide the green-tinted white flowers. It is hardy in zones 4-8. P. falcatum is an East Asian species hardy in zones 4-9, seldom seen in cultivation in the West, and plants offered under this name are often actually another species. It grows 2½-3 feet tall, with cream flowers tipped in green. The variegated cultivar ‘Nippon Sunbeam’ has green leaves striped with yellow. ‘Silver Lining’ has silver stripes on the leaves. P. humile, dwarf solomon’s-seal, is native to Japan. As its common name suggests, this is a smaller-statured species that is more delicate in appearance, but its flowers are relatively large for such a small plant and are therefore more showy than other Polygonatum species. It rarely grows more than 8-12” tall and is less hardy (zones 6-9). P. latifolium, native to the Caucasus region and hardy in zones 5-8, has leaves that are pubescent on the undersides. The flowers are white with a reflexed frilled green edge. The plant grows 8-12” tall. P. multiflorum is another European species. ‘Variegatum’ is a short selection (under 2 feet) with cream and green leaves on reddish stalks. P. odoratum Thunbergi ( = japonicum ), fragrant or Japanese solomon’s-seal, is native to Japan. The plants grow 18-36” tall with reddish stems and have fragrant white flowers. It is hardy in zones 4-8. There are several cultivars of this species including: ‘Fireworks’ – has leaves with white margins and cream to yellow stripes, along with red stems. ‘Flora Plenum’ – has double flowers with multiple tepals. ‘Lemon Seoul’ – with light green leaves with a silver underside. ‘Variegatum’ (variegated solomon’s-seal) – with variable creamy white “brushstrokes” on the leaves. In spring there may be a blush of pink to the leaves. P. pubescens, hairy solomon’s-seal, is native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia south to Georgia, and west to Manitoba and Indiana. It is very similar in appearance to P. biflorum but tends to be shorter (1-3 feet tall) and its leaves are slightly hairy on the undersides, primarily along the veins. In addition to the “true” solomon’s-seals, there are other plants that are called solomon’s seal, including: Evergreen solomon’s seal (Disporopsis pernyi), native to high-altitude forests in China, has glossy, dark green foliage and lemon-scented flowers. Like Polygonatum it has hanging flowers followed by purple berries. False solomon’s-seal (Maianthemum racemosum) has similar foliage, but bears terminal flowers and fruit."

Title: Boxwood Diseases & Insect Pests | Home & Garden Information Center
wind protection. this is especially important in upstate areas where the soil can freeze and remain frozen on sunny days. when this happens, the foliage continues to transpire, but the roots cannot replace the lost moisture from the frozen soil. if boxwoods have died and boxwood decline disease is confirmed, do not plant english boxwood ( buxus sempervirens ‘ suffruiticosa ’ ) in the same site. american boxwood ( buxus sempervirens ) and littleleaf boxwood ( b. microphylla ) can be used as a replacement as they are resistant to decline. however, if phytophthora root rot is confirmed, the site should be avoided for future boxwood plantings. root rot : root rot is caused by the fungi phytophthora nicotianae and p. cinnamomi. leaves turn from normal dark green to light green as the plant declines. roots are dark and rotted, and the bark rots and peels at the crown. the death of the entire plant is characteristic of this disease. prevention & treatment : high soil moisture and warm soil temperatures are conditions that favor root rot. the disease is more severe in heavy clays or poorly drained soils. over - watering plants or long periods of heavy rain also favor disease development. phytophthora root rot must be prevented, as chemicals are often ineffective in controlling this disease after above - ground symptoms become obvious. the following suggestions may aid in the prevention of root rot : - purchase disease - free plants from a reputable nursery. - in areas where plants susceptible to root rot have died, replant with plants that are not susceptible. - plant root rot - susceptible plants in well - drained areas or in raised beds. if the soil is heavy clay, mix it with a porous material such as composted pine bark. - the soil around infected plants may be treated with the appropriate fungicide according to the directions on the label. this may reduce the spread of the fungus among plants, but these chemicals may not kill the fungus in infected plants. read and follow all directions on the fungicide label. canker or stem blight : this disease is caused by the fungus volutella buxi. the first noticeable symptom is that certain branches or certain plants in a group do not start new growth as early in the spring as do others, nor is the new growth as vigorous as that on healthy specimens. the leaves turn from normal to light green to various shades of tan. infected leaves turn upward and lie close to the stem instead of spreading out like the leaves on healthy stems. the diseased leaves and branches show small, rose - colored, waxy fruiting bodies of the fungus. the bark at the base of an infected branch is loose and peels off readily from the gray to black discolored wood beneath. prevention & treatment : dead branches should be removed as soon as they are noticeable. the annual removal and destruction of all leaves that have lodged in crotches is recommended. applications of a copper - based fungicide have been shown to be very effective in preventing canker. the first application should be made after the dead leaves and dying branches have been removed and before growth starts in the spring. see table 1 for examples of products. as with all pesticides, read and follow all label instructions and precautions. boxwood blight : boxwood blight is caused by the fungal pathogen calonectria pseudonaviculata ( synonym cylindrocladium pseudonaviculatum ), which causes leaf spots, stem cankers, defoliation, and death of boxwoods. other plants that are related to boxwoods may also be hosts, such as pachysandra and sweet box ( sarcococca species ). there are no known resistant boxwoods, but a few have been tested and found to be more tolerant, such as b. sinica var. insularis ‘ nana ’ and b. microphylla var. japonica ‘ green beauty ’. as the disease spreads within a boxwood shrub, additional leaf spots form and coalesce until entire leaf surfaces are infected, and these blighted leaves then drop from the plant. stems become infected and form dark brown to black lesions or cankers. once the cankers encircle a stem, the water supply is cut off from that point outward, and the stem dies. the pathogen can survive for at least five years on blighted and fallen foliage, as well as on the stem lesions on the dying or dead plants. rainfall and overhead irrigation may splash the spores to adjacent plants. prevention & treatment : boxwood blight may be confused with other boxwood diseases, such as boxwood decline or other stem blight diseases. if boxwood blight is suspected, have the disease identified. plant samples can be sent for identification to the clemson plant & pest diagnostic clinic. prune out the diseased stems, rake up fallen foliage, and dispose of both. do not put diseased plant material into a compost pile. leaves and dying plants should be buried, burned, or bagged and placed with the trash for going to the landfill. apply fresh mulch beneath the plants to reduce the chances of reinfection from spores that could splash from the soil onto foliage. the more effective homeowner fungicides for the control of boxwood blight are chlorothalonil or chlorothalonil mixed with thiophanate methyl. see table 1 for examples of brands and specific products. other non - susceptible plants can be used in the landscape to replace boxwoods, such as dwarf yaupon hollies and japanese hollies, both of which have small leaves and look quite similar to boxwoods. nematodes : boxwoods are susceptible to several parasitic nematodes ( microscopic round worms ), including the southern root - knot nematode ( meloidogyne incognita ), the ring nematode ( mesocriconema ), the lesion nematode ( pratylenchus ), and the stunt nematode ( tylenchorhynchus ). symptoms consist of leaf bronzing, stunted growth, and general decline of the boxwood. the microscopic worms feed on the roots, which soon die and the plant forms lateral roots above the invaded area. these lateral roots, in turn, are infested. repeated infestations and lateral root production result in a stunted root system resembling a witches ’ broom. prevention & treatment : the life of infested plants may be prolonged by providing good care ( fertilization, mulching ) and by watering the plants thoroughly during dry spells. american boxwood ( b. sempervirens ) is resistant to root - knot nematodes and tolerant to stunt nematodes. nematodes cannot be totally eliminated from the landscape. the goal is to keep the population low enough to prevent damaging symptoms that weaken the plant. boxwoods should not be grown in soils heavily infested with nematodes. growing plants that are not affected by nematodes ( grasses, marigolds ) will reduce nematode populations in the long term. nematode - tolerant shrubs such as yaupon holly and burford holly can be used to replace boxwoods, which were killed by nematodes. insects & related pests boxwood leafminer ( monarthropalpus flavus ) : this is the most serious insect pest that attacks boxwood. the leafminer is the larva ( immature form ) of a small, orangish mosquito - like fly. these flies are less than - inch long and can often be seen swarming around boxwoods in the spring. the adult female fly inserts eggs with her ovipositor ( egg laying structure ) into new boxwood leaves through the leaf ’ s upper surface. when the larvae hatch, they feed inside the leaf, creating a mine. larvae are orange and about - inch in length. they overwinter ( survive the winter ) inside the leaves. adults emerge from the leaves the following spring, just after new growth occurs on boxwoods. there is one generation per year. american boxwood is the preferred host plant, but english and japanese boxwoods ( b. microphylla var. japonica ) are also susceptible. boxwood leafminer attacks result in irregularly shaped swellings on the leaf. there may be a slightly blistered appearance on the leaf ’ s undersurface. blistering may not be obvious until late summer. infested leaves typically turn yellow or brown in splotches, are smaller, and drop sooner than healthy leaves. a heavy infestation can cause serious loss of leaves and result in the death of the boxwood. prevention & control : use of insecticides against boxwood leafminer is not recommended unless damage is intolerable. insecticides are most effective against this pest when adults have emerged and before they can lay eggs. adults typically emerge over a three - week period but live only a few days contact insecticides that are effective against boxwood leafminer adults and are labeled for homeowner use include malathion. with these insecticides, begin treatment in mid - april to early may when the adult flies are seen hovering around the boxwood plants. foliar systemic insecticides, such as sprays with acephate or spinosad, are effective when leafminers are present in mines. soil treatments with dinotefuran or imidacloprid will control leafminers, but may take two weeks or more to begin providing season - long control. dinotefuran may move into shrubs more quickly than imidacloprid for faster control. see table 1 for examples of products. as with all pesticides, read and follow all label instructions and precautions. boxwood mite ( eurytetranychus buxi ) : the adult is a small, greenish insect, about - inch long. the adult is green to yellowish - brown in color, has eight legs, and is tiny, about 1 / 64 - inch long. since mites are so small and early symptoms are not distinctive, it is easy to overlook the problem until a heavy infestation occurs and greater damage has occurred. this pest overwinters as eggs on the underside of leaves, and the eggs hatch in the spring. boxwood mites develop and breed rapidly, resulting in eight or more generations per year. all stages of boxwood mite feed on both leaf surfaces. they pierce the leaf to suck out plant sap. during feeding, they inject toxic saliva, which results in stippling ( tiny, yellow scratch - like spots ) forming on the leaf ’ s upper surface. boxwood mites prefer feeding on young leaves, but the damage is most obvious on second - and third - year leaves. from a short distance, the infested boxwood appears unhealthy with a dingy silvery color. prevention & control : naturally occurring enemies of mites include various predatory mites, ladybird beetles ( ladybugs ), and other insects. these predators will usually suppress mite populations. since insecticide use kills predators as well as mites, insecticides should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. to determine whether insecticide use is needed, it helps to know how many mites are present. hold a white sheet of paper under a branch and strike the branch. the mites that are knocked off will be seen crawling around on the paper. if more than 15 mites are seen per whack, serious damage can result. mites can be removed with a strong spray of water if applied on a regular basis. horticultural oil applied at the summer rate of 1 – 2 % ( 2 - 1 / 2 to 5 tablespoons oil per gallon of water ) will kill eggs and adult mites. horticultural oil may be sprayed when temperatures are between 45 and 85 degrees. insecticidal soaps can also provide control when applied before population numbers get too high. miticides labeled for homeowner use against boxwood mites include tau - fluvalinate. these products should be applied when mites are present and again in seven to 10 days. see table 1 for examples of products. as with all pesticides, read and follow all label instructions and precautions. boxwood psyllid ( psylla buxi ) : the adult is a small, greenish insect, about - inch long. the adult is green to yellowish - brown in color, has eight legs, and is tiny, about 1 / 64 - inch long. since mites are so small and early symptoms are not distinctive, it is easy to overlook the problem until a heavy infestation occurs and greater damage has occurred. this pest overwinters as eggs on the underside of leaves, and the eggs hatch in the spring. boxwood mites develop and breed rapidly, resulting in eight or more generations per year. all stages of boxwood mite feed on both leaf surfaces. they pierce the leaf to suck out plant sap. during feeding, they inject toxic saliva, which results in stippling ( tiny, yellow scratch -

User > My Charentais melon seedlings all have brown, wilty bottom leaves. All of them. I planted them in potting soil and have just started using a veggie fertilizer on them each watering hoping that will help. They get east morning sun and west afternoon window (no sun). The top leaves are fine and they are getting vines on them. What could be causing the bottom leaves of my melon seedlings to be brown and wilty?

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and yew, are commonly grown as formal hedges but cannot be renovated in this way. do not prune these shrubs back into dead portions of the branches, as this will create large open gaps in the hedge, and these species do not readily fill in those gaps with new growth. if these hedge species become too large or unattractive, they will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. pruning overgrown evergreen shrubs large, overgrown evergreen shrubs with scale and needle - like foliage, such as juniper and pine, and some with broad leaves, like boxwood, are a more complex problem. large evergreen shrubs possess bare or dead zones in their centers. they cannot be pruned back severely because they are incapable of initiating new growth from bare branches. this means that these shrubs can only be reduced in size to a certain extent, as they should only be pruned back to green areas. do not prune evergreen shrubs back into dead portions of the branches. any large hole or gap in the canopy revealed by pruning will always remain. large, overgrown junipers, spruces, pines, or other conifers that have become too large or unattractive will need to be removed and new shrubs planted. some species, such as yew and, to a lesser extent, boxwood and arborvitae, can initiate some new growth from bare stems and may eventually fill in, but this process can take a considerable amount of time. this means these evergreen shrubs, when severely pruned, may be unattractive for five or more years, and some may never fully fill in. often, it is best to remove and replace even these shrubs to maintain an attractive planting.
Title: How to Prune Japanese Maples - PlantingTree
sunny days, as it causes more shock damage to the tree. with respect to timing, one question we commonly get is whether or not you can prune in the spring and fall. the answer is yes you can, however, it ’ s a good practice to be cautious when pruning at these times. pruning too heavily in the spring can cause damage to new buds and stunt growth. whereas pruning too late in the season can stimulate new growth which can be quickly damaged by freezing late fall temperatures where to cut when pruning the purpose of pruning is to encourage your tree ’ s natural growth habit. that being said, there are 5 types of branches you may want to consider removing from your japanese maple. - broken, diseased, or dead branches. these need to go for obvious reasons. prune them when you see them, no matter the time of year. - branches growing inward or in the wrong direction. while strange - looking branches can add character to a tree, they can also cause a lot of problems, particularly if they are growing inward. - crossing branches can result in damage to both the bark and the branches. this can encourage disease and pests, which is something you don ’ t want. if you find that you have several branches crossing in one area, you may consider removing a branch or two. - narrow crotches. this is where two branches meet at an angle of less than 45 degrees. remove one of the branches to open up your tree and reduce the possibility of breakage. - crowded branches. removing crowded branches is most important when it involves the crown of the tree. when you remove crowded branches and foliage in this area, it will increase airflow and help your tree breathe better. you can thin these areas by removing one out of every four branches or so. pruning tips & tricks where you cut matters when removing an entire branch, prune at a 45 - degree angle back to the branch collar, but not into it. basically, there shouldn ’ t be much of the branch left but you should never cut flush to the connecting branch or trunk. be sure to use clean, professional pruners for the best results. - do not prune young trees unless absolutely necessary. allow your tree to fully develop and grow into itself for 10 to 15 years before you do any serious pruning. - younger trees often get long, thin, whip - like branches. you may be tempted to prune off these scrawny long branches. however, it ’ s better if you don ’ t. be patient. they will fill out and get lateral branches. if you prune them off you are more likely to get even more of this same branch type. - don ’ t buy a japanese maple that grows too tall for the spot you have chosen. pruning japanese maples to control height is a fight you won ’ t win. it will only encourage faster growth and thinner, weaker branches. - do not prune off more than of the foliage or the crown of your japanese maple. - never over - prune. while aesthetic pruning of japanese maples is certainly an acceptable practice, we advise that you prune when necessary. believe it or not, sometimes less really is more. now you know how to prune japanese maples. just remember to be patient, take your time, and a little pruning maintenance can go a long way. plantingtree"

Next, I gathered another egg that had fallen to the floor, causing the outside shell to break open, and I noticed something unusual: white dots about the size of sesame seeds inside the egg. I'm wondering what this is, perhaps too big to be worm eggs? Upon opening the egg, I observed that the white connective strands seemed bigger than usual, but no worms or white round things were present. If my hen has worms, how should I treat them to get rid of them? [Note: I will attach pictures.]

User > I have a quandary about my River Lupine plants. I planted several two years ago – the plants are doing great as you can see, but the flowers have been an unexpected off-white. Normally, I’ve seen them as a purple or blue at our project sites, so I was wondering if I just received a different variety or if I have something wrong with my soil or something else entirely. The blooms have also died back pretty quickly in comparison to other varieties I’ve seen. I have been battling some aphids on them (just spraying them off or spraying with a dawn solution). Would love any advice you can provide.

Title: What Happened To the Drones? Keeping Backyard Bees
What happened To the Drones
The weather has started cooling in NE Ga, and hive activity has changed with the season. One very noticeable change is the drone activity. As I walk the bee yard observing the hives and performing final inspections of the season, it is not uncommon to see lots of drones wandering around under the hives, or to find piles of dead bees drones on the ground. In the fall, this is a sure sign the male honeybee has been evicted from his home.
The cool air of fall signals the nearing end to the beekeepers season. While we perform final inspections and begin to clean up activities, the honeybees perform a clean up of their own. The worker bees serve an eviction notice, and kick the drones to the curb! They are banished from the hive and left to starve or freeze to death.
The question new beekeepers may be asking is, “Why?” To answer that you first have to understand the role of the drone to the hive and look at what they don’t do for the hive.
- They do not build comb.
- They do not gather nectar or pollen.
- They do not protect the hive.
- Some books say they don’t even feed themselves, the worker bees have to feed them!
- As a matter of fact, drones are useless except for mating with a queen. They venture from the hive each day and go hand out at the drone congregation area and wait for a queen to fly by in hopes of mating with her after which they promptly die.
So to ensure having enough stores for the queen, the workers and any brood that may be reared during the winter, the drones are expelled. The hive will not spare the food to feed the drones.
In my bee yards, I have observed this banishment play out in a variety of ways.
- I have watched drones simply be prevented from entering the hive. The guard bees block their way or sometimes they will drag them to the edge and throw them off.
- I have been inspecting a hive and watched one or two bees grab a drone and drag him out of the hive. Sometimes they throw him over the edge and sometimes they fly away with him.
- I have watched them wander around on the outside of the hive and on the ground. Some of them had their wings chewed on. The wings looked very ragged and they resembled varroa mite symptoms. (When in doubt of the cause, INSPECT!)
The worst thing I have observed is the removal of drone pupae from their capped cells. The pupae were on the ground and on the hive porch. Seeing this was very distressing and caused me to check the pupae for varroa also.
I hope this helps prepare you for some of the possible occurrences in the bee yard during the fall months. If you are not sure of what you are seeing, try finding a seasoned beekeeper to ask questions, and inspect your hive! I believe if something is wrong it is better to treat it late than not at all.
This post does not reflect the latest scientific information showing that drones have more benefits to the colony than has been traditionally articulated. Drones have been shown to be important in thermoregulation of the hive and to a overall beneficial effect on the harmony of the colony. In some climates, such as mine in Southern California, drones are being raised year ’round, swarming is year ’round, and hive activity is year ’round.

User > What could be causing my sick junipers? A year ago I planted 11 low growing junipers along the edge of a short retaining wall. This spring one died, turning brown starting in the center and spreading to the new growth at the edges. The other 10 doubled in size the past several months putting on a lot of new growth at the ends of the branches. The last couple weeks 3 more of the junipers are starting to turn yellow brown near the center and the discoloration is spreading outward. They are not contiguously located but are scattered along the wall. Any suggestions?

Title: Juniper Diseases & Insect Pests | Home & Garden Information Center
junipers grown in south carolina are relatively low - maintenance plants if planted in the correct location and given proper cultural care. there are several common problems that can cause browning of needles and dieback of entire shoots, especially when junipers are improperly planted or under stress from the environment. avoid many of these problems by selecting resistant varieties, avoiding overhead watering, and selecting a planting site with good drainage. more information is available in hgic 1068, juniper. twig & tip blights : junipers frequently exhibit dieback of shoot tips or entire shoots and browning of needles. needles may drop from the plant, and dark cankers may form at the junction of live and dead wood. this problem occurs typically during warm, wet weather conditions and is usually caused by one of the fungal organisms described below. phomopsis tip blight : this disease is caused by the fungus phomopsis juniperovora and begins by infecting the tips of branches smaller than the diameter of a pencil. the new, immature growth becomes infected while the darker green, mature foliage remains resistant to infection. infected twigs first become pale, then turn reddish - brown and finally become brown after death. scraping away the bark will reveal a sharp line between discolored, dead wood and healthy wood. watch for disease development during the spring or summer flush of new growth when warm, wet conditions are present. cercospora twig blight : this disease is caused by the fungus cercospora sequoiae var. juniperi. it begins by infecting the oldest needles that are located on the lower branches, inside of the plant. as disease development progresses, the needle browning spreads upward and outward. branch tips usually remain healthy and green. needles of spur branches turn brown and die usually in the late summer, leaving a plant with an inner crown devoid of foliage. this disease is sometimes confused with mite damage. prevention & treatment : each of these diseases requires similar methods of control. first, closely inspect the entire plant, since symptoms of tip blight and twig blight can be caused by other problems, such as drought, overwatering, or root injury. purchase disease - resistant varieties that are healthy with no evidence of dead or dying twigs. do not stress junipers by planting them in shaded or poorly drained locations. plant junipers in areas with good air circulation to promote rapid drying of the needles. do not crowd plants, and avoid using sprinkler irrigation. promptly prune and remove any diseased or browning branches as they occur. except on highly susceptible cultivars, pruning will usually control these diseases. if chemical control is necessary, fungicides are available to provide protection, but they must be applied before infection occurs. select a fungicide labeled for use on junipers containing one of the following : mancozeb, thiophanate - methyl, or copper fungicides. see table 1 for examples of products. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. kabatina twig blight : this disease is caused by the fungus kabatina juniperi. the symptoms are the same as described for phomopsis tip blight, except this fungus kills older ( usually 1 - year - old ) twigs in the spring. damaged or stressed tissues are more susceptible to kabatina twig blight. cedar - apple rust : this fungal disease of apple, crabapple, various junipers, and eastern red cedar is caused by several species of gymnosporangium. the disease not only affects juniperus species, including eastern red cedar ( juniperus virginiana ), but requires an alternate host plant, most commonly apple or crabapple, to complete its life cycle. this disease spreads from junipers to apples or crabapples and then back to junipers. it can be a severe problem wherever these two types of plants are grown together. eastern red cedar is the most commonly infected juniper. on juniper, hard, brown, up to 2 - inch diameter galls form near the ends of the branches in the summer. in the spring following a rain, the galls produce large, orange, gelatin - like tendrils, full of spores, which can blow a half - mile to infect nearby apple and crabapple trees. symptoms that occur on the apple trees appear as yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. in the late summer, these yellow spots form spores that are spread to the leaves and twigs of nearby junipers ( within 2 miles ) to infect them. prevention & treatment : select resistant varieties of apple ( such as ‘ enterprise ’, ‘ pristine ’, ‘ liberty ’ or ‘ redfree ’ ) or juniper. prune out all galls on the juniper, if possible. do not plant apple or crabapple trees near eastern red cedars. if disease is severe enough to warrant control, or a particular specimen plant is affected, select a fungicide containing mancozeb or propiconazole. see table 1 for examples of products. do not use fruit for food if propiconazole products are used. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. more information is available in hgic 2000, apple and crabapple diseases. the following juniper varieties are generally resistant to phomopsis twig blight & cedar rusts ; - juniperus chinensis – chinese juniper - var. sargentii ( sargent juniper ) - j. communis – common juniper - j. squamata – singleseed juniper - j. sabina – savin juniper - j. virginiana – eastern red cedar - j. horizontalis – creeping juniper - j. horizontalis – creeping juniper - ‘ wiltoni ’ ( ‘ blue rug ’ ) phytophthora root rot : this root rot is one of the most serious and difficult - to - control fungal diseases that affects a wide range of plants in south carolina. it is caused by a soil - borne water mold ( phytophthora cinnamomi ), and the most common symptom is the slow decline of the plant. needles on the plant will become thin or sparse. some plants may die one branch at a time, until the entire plant dies. the centers of the roots change from white to reddish - brown and the outer layer of the roots separates easily from the core. high soil moisture and warm soil temperatures favor disease development. prevention & treatment : it is important to prevent this disease by cultural methods, since chemical treatment is ineffective once symptoms are noticed. avoid planting in poorly drained areas where phytophthora root rot thrives. heavy clay soils, areas that flood and sites where runoff water is a problem typically create root rot problems. plant junipers in raised beds, except in deep sandy soils. if you must plant in a site that has heavy clay or does not have good internal drainage, amend the site by thoroughly mixing a porous material, such as ground pine bark ( not sawdust or peat ), into the bed to a depth of 8 to 12 inches. avoid varieties that are the most susceptible to root rot. some highly susceptible junipers that are likely to be killed by the root rot fungus include : ‘ andorra, ’ ‘ bar harbor, ’ ‘ parsoni, ’ ‘ sargents, ’ ‘ shore ’ and juniperus procumbens ‘ nana. ’ fungicides can be effective on a preventative basis only, and repeat applications are required. fungicides containing mefenoxam ( subdue gr ) can be applied in the home landscape to suppress disease, but it will not cure an infected plant. due to product cost and for accurate application, homeowners may want to hire a licensed landscaper to apply products containing these fungicides. apply all chemicals according to directions on the label. insects & other pests bagworm : bagworm ( thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis ) infests many shrubs and trees, but conifers ( evergreens ) are the preferred hosts. damage to plants results from feeding by the caterpillar, which causes loss of needles. mild infestations of this pest slow the growth of junipers. heavy infestations can kill a plant. the adult male is a dark - colored, hairy moth with a 1 - inch wingspan and clear wings. the adult female is yellow and appears almost maggot - like. the larva ( immature form or caterpillar ) produces a carrot - shaped bag that it carries with it as it feeds. the bag is formed from silk that the larva produces. as it feeds, the larva adds bits of plant material to the bag. the bag is about 2 inches when complete. in south carolina, bagworms survive the winter as eggs in a bag. the larvae hatch during may. they spin their cases and carry them along as they feed. after further development, the adult male emerges from its bag in late summer. it locates an adult female in her bag. after mating, the female lays 500 to 1, 000 eggs in her bag and dies. prevention & control : several parasites and predators feed on bagworms, generally keeping their numbers under control. removal of the egg - containing bags during winter and early spring is a very effective method for preventing problems before the next growing season. once removed, destroy or dispose of the bags or place them in a deep container, which allows beneficial parasites that may also be present in the bags to escape while retaining the bagworm larvae. if the infestation is severe or the bags are out of reach, spray with the bacterial

User > How to get rid of yellow trumpet vines? I planted 2 yellow trumpet vines on either side of an arbor over 10 yrs ago. The greenery grows good but has never bloomed with flowers. I have tried everything recommended. We decided we’re gonna dig them up and plant Clematis there last year which we did but then the suckers kept growing up through the clematis so we want to totally kill the foliage in that whole area and start over. How would you recommend we do that?

##y antennae. the tent caterpillar larvae grow to 2 ” long or more. they ’ re dark with yellow tufts and a white stripe running down their back. female moths lay eggs in shiny, dark - brown masses that encircle small branches, where they overwinter. in spring, the eggs hatch and the caterpillar larvae begin defoliating leaves on the host tree. after a month or so, the larvae mature and crawl down to the ground to find a sheltered place to make their white cocoons. the pupae develop in a matter of weeks and emerge as adult moths to mate and lay eggs for the following year ’ s generation. eastern tent caterpillars spin dense webs in the forks and crotches of trees, not at the ends of branches as webworms do. tent caterpillars emerge during the day to feed on leaves, and return to their communal webs at night. controlling eastern tent caterpillar the best way to reduce next year ’ s population is to remove and destroy egg masses in fall and winter. the pests also have several natural predators, including many bird species, which eat the caterpillar larvae during daylight hours. if those measures aren ’ t enough, you can spray caterpillar larvae with pesticides. this should be done as early in spring as possible when the larvae are small. it may be difficult to spray effectively when little foliage has emerged, but direct spraying will kill the larvae. as with fall webworm, spraying the webs will not reach the larvae sheltering inside. apply residual, foliar insecticide sprays to leaves and twigs during the day when caterpillars are out eating leaves and reapply it regularly. if you ’ re spraying fruit trees, only use insecticides designed for fruiting trees. do not burn webs! fire and flames can seriously damage your trees. the spongy moth ( lymantria dispar dispar ) is a major pest of hardwood trees in northern virginia, as larvae rapidly defoliate trees. the caterpillars are an inch or more in length, black or brown, with spots along their backs and tufts of bristle - like hairs. female moths have white wings with black markings, and are flightless. male moths have darker, brownish wings with black markings, feather - like antennae, and can fly. spongy moth egg masses are tan, and covered with wing scales from the adult female moth. the masses hold hundreds of eggs, and can be found on outdoor surfaces of all kinds. moving items that hold spongy moth eggs is one way the insect is spread, so inspecting all items is vital to prevent the insect ’ s spread. adult moths in emerge in early summer, after pupating. the adult moths mate in summer, and female moths lay eggs that will overwinter, hatching the following spring. spongy moth larvae ( caterpillars ) hatch in spring, and voraciously defoliate trees as they go through their larval stages. while annual populations of spongy moth fluctuate, severe or repeated defoliation of garden and forest trees can kill large numbers of trees. its preferred species is oak ( quercus ), but spongy moth caterpillars feed on hundreds of tree species, including : - boxelder ( acer negundo ) - american mountain ash ( sorbus ) - lombardy poplar ( 

Title: Pests of Tomato | NC State Extension Publications
a wasp parasite, cotesia congregata. parasitized hornworms are easily recognized by the small, white, oblong cocoons attached to their backs ( figure 22b and figure 22c ). leave these worms in the garden so the emerging wasps can parasitize other hornworms. for chemical recommendations, consult the north carolina agricultural chemicals manual. silverleaf whitefly, bemisia argentifolii bellows and perring, aleyrodidae, homoptera adult — the silverleaf whitefly ( figure 23a ) is slightly smaller and slightly yellower than other whiteflies. the female is almost 1 / 16 inch long, and the male is somewhat smaller ( figure 24 ). the wings are held rooflike at about a 45 - degree angle, whereas other whiteflies usually hold their wings nearly flat over the body. hence, the silverleaf whitefly appears more slender than other common whiteflies. egg — the eggs are whitish to light beige with the apex tending to be slightly darker. the eggs are inserted on end into the undersides of new leaves ( figure 23b ). nymph — the nymphal stage appears glassy to opaque yellowish and may or may not have dorsal spines, depending on leaf characteristics. the body is flattened and scalelike, with the margins relatively near the leaf surface ( figure 23c and figure 23d ). pupa — the pupa or fourth nymphal instar is somewhat darker beige - yellow and opaque. pupae are plumper than previous nymphal stages ( figure 24 ). some of the spiracular furrows have a small amount of white wax deposits. the caudal setae are prominent, and the caudal end is somewhat acute. dorsal spines are present when the host leaf is hairy and absent when the host leaf is smooth. the outer edges of the body are rounded. distribution — the silverleaf whitefly occurs around the world in tropical and subtropical areas and in greenhouses in temperate areas. host plants — the number of host plants is extensive. the plant families most often reported as hosts are amaranthaceae, compositae, convolvulaceae, cruciferae, cucurbitaceae, euphorbiaceae, labiatae, leguminosae, malvaceae, moraceae, rosaceae, solanaceae, and verbenaceae. in addition to tomato, the most frequently reported hosts in the southeastern united states are poinsettia and gerbera daisy. damage — adults and nymphs cause direct damage by removing sap. chlorotic spots sometimes appear at the feeding sites on leaves, and heavy infestations cause leaf wilting. the excretion of honeydew and the subsequent development of sooty mold fungi also may reduce photosynthesis and other physiological functions of the plant. even though the silverleaf whitefly is considered an economic pest, little information is known about the damage it causes or the economic thresholds in tomatoes. life history — developmental times from egg deposition to adult emergence vary from 16 to 38 days and appear to be primarily influenced by temperature, humidity, and the host plant. the number of eggs laid by each female over her lifetime varies considerably, but is usually about 90. reports from israel indicate that repeated applications of insecticides have produced a resistant, highly fecund strain of silverleaf whitefly, with the females capable of

Title: White Trillium grandiflorum, Wake Robin | American Meadows
how do we use your location? knowing your location helps us recommend plants that will thrive in your climate, based on your growing zone. a great companion plant is our yellow violet which blooms at exactly the same time. a bed of these trilliums, yellow violets and a few unfurling ferns make a spring show that is truly breathtaking. our trillium plants are nursery propagated from seed. about the great white trillium there is great lore and legend about this plant, and also quite a bit of misinformation. many people believe it is endangered which it is not. it may be protected in some places, but where it thrives, it grows in great abundance. it is the provincial flower of ontario, and is quite common there and around the great lakes. it is also the official wildflower of ohio. in new england, it is rare in all the states except vermont, where it grows in huge drifts near lake champlain. unlike other trilliums ( such as the red trillium ) which are solitary, standing alone in the woods, the great white trillium forms large drifts over the years, creating one of north americas most beautiful spring wildflower displays. best of all, the great white trillium is quite easy to transplant and grow, making it a great choice for your wild garden. the trillium tribe, and why its so famous. the classic 4 - inch thick botanical reference work, hortus third, tells us that there are about 30 species of trillium worldwide, but the majority of the species are native to north america. a very few originate in japan and korea, none in europe. this is one reason that our colonists were so taken with these woodland beauties when they arrived. they had simply never seen anything like them. trilliums, as the name implies have everything in 3s - - three leaves, three petals, etc. and compared to the other spring flowers that bloom when winter is finally over in our cold climates, the trilliums are the ones with large look - at - me flowers. they were famous with the indians before colonization, and instantly the stars of spring bloom with the colonists. remember, when the colonists arrived, they arrived on our east coast which was totally wooded - - big, primeval old growth forest, right down to the beaches. and under these cathedral - like trees were the woodland native flowers - - almost all species the europeans had never seen. also, this is why almost all the native flowers of our east coast are woodland plants, not meadow wildflowers. of this famous original group of woodland wildflowers, which includes the lady slippers, mayflower, hepatica and many more, the trilliums reigned supreme. for centuries the flowers were picked heavily, which is unfortunate since a picked trillium is a dead trillium. but it was the clearing of the forests for farming, a necessity for the colonists, that really devastated the woodland wildflowers. we like to wring our hands about paving for interstates and new condominium projects today, but we needn't. the damage was done long ago when our ancestors cleared the eastern forests for farming. of course, there are relatively small habitats left, and in recent years, our forested area has been enlarging, and woodland wildflower habitat has been restored in many places. in any case, this elegant class of flowers, the trilliums, are now recognized as precious and special, although they are not officially endangered. in many areas, trilliums are still very common. wildflower gardeners love them, and it is true that most of them are not difficult to grow or transplant, and if conditions are good, they thrive. however, it does help to know the facts. here's how they are propagated. trilliums such as the great white spread very slowly by underground root stocks, and the seed produced creates new plants even more slowly. from a planted seed, it takes approximately five to nine years for a trillium grandiflorum plant ( the great white trillium ) to bloom. so when you see a massive drift of these in spring, you know you're looking at a bunch of plants that are at least a decade old, probably much older. these plants are not daisies! and how do they propagate themselves? well, t. grandiflorum is one of the wildflowers whose seeds are distributed by ants. yes, ants - - not birds or bees, or the wind, but ants. this is why the species creates large close drifts over the years. plants are never very far apart, since ants don't travel far. so each clump of t. grandiflorum you see was planted where you see it by an ant. ( they carry the seeds away when they fall from the plant because the ants enjoy the sticky covering each seed case has when it falls to the ground. ) that brings us to the basic rarity of the trilliums. a big factor is that each flower produces only one seed case when it fades. ( everybody knows that most flowers - - a daisy, for example, produces hundreds of loose seeds from each flower. ) so even if the ants find the sticky seed case, and take it underground where the several seeds inside can grow, there simply aren't huge numbers of white trillium seeds being planted each year. other trillium species have various propagation strategies, but all take years and years. now you have some idea of the value of these beautiful plants. they are an important part of american botanical history, and deserve a place of honor in every american wildflower garden. here are the best known species, with a little info on each : trillium grandiflorum, great white trillium. the provincial flower of ontario, and quite common there and around the great lakes. also the official wildflower of ohio, t. grandiflorum is native over most of the east, from canada to georgia, especially in neutral or non - acid soils. large white flowers fade to pink ; plants form large drifts. trillium erectum, red trillium. also called wake robin and stinking benjamin, the second because of the flowers unpleasant odor, said to be similar to rotting meat. propagated by flies. red to purple flowers ; plants solitary in acid or alkaline woods. native to the eastern forests from canada to georgia. trillium undulatum, painted trillium. smaller than the great white or red, but with one of the most beautiful flowers - - white with purplish / red centers. must have highly acidic soil ; common in pine woods. native to forests from canada to georgia. trillium catesbaei, rosy trillium or catesby trillium. one of the first trilliums discovered and named for mark catesby, the famous early british plant explorer and artist. the rosy trillium has somewhat smallish blooms which nod below the leaves. it is native to the southeast, where catesby visited. trillium viride var luteum, yellow trillium. this unusual trillium has mottled leaves and lemon yellow blooms that hold their petals high and never really open. it is often said to have a lemon scent, and is native from kentucky south to florida. trillium ovatum, coast trillium. this is a famous western trillium, much like t. grandiflorum in the east. flowers are white, fading to pink. it is native from british columbia through coastal forests all the way to central california. as soon as your order is placed you will receive a confirmation email. you will receive a second email the day your order ships telling you how it has been sent. some perennials are shipped as potted plants, some as perennial roots packed in peat. the ‘ plant information ’ section describes how that item will ship. all perennials and fall - planted bulbs are packaged to withstand shipping and are fully - guaranteed. please open upon receipt and follow the instructions included. perennials and fall - planted bulb orders will arrive separately from seeds. if your order requires more than one shipment and all items are shipping to the same address, there is no additional shipping charge. see our shipping information page for approximate ship dates and more detailed information. if you have any questions, please call customer service at ( 802 ) 227 - 7200 or contact us by email or chat. the trillium tribe, and why its so famous. the classic 4 - inch thick botanical reference work, hortus third, tells us that there are about 30 species of trillium worldwide, but the majority of the species are native to north america. a very few originate in japan and korea, none in europe. this is one reason that our colonists were so taken with these woodland beauties when they arrived. they had simply never seen anything like them. trilliums, as the name implies have everything in 3s - - three leaves, three petals, etc. and compared to the other spring flowers that bloom when winter is finally over in our cold climates, the trilliums are the ones with large look - at - me flowers. they were famous with the indians before colonization, and instantly the stars of spring bloom with the colonists. remember, when the colonists arrived, they arrived on our east coast which was totally wooded - - big, primeval old growth forest, right down to the beaches. and under these cathedral - like trees were the woodland native flowers - - almost all species the europeans had never seen. also, this is why almost all the native flowers of our east coast are woodland plants, not meadow wildflowers. of this famous original group of woodland wildflowers, which includes the lady slippers, mayflower, hepatica and many more, the trilliums reigned supreme. for centuries the flowers were picked heavily, which is unfortunate since a picked trillium is a dead trillium. but it was the clearing of the forests for farming, a necessity for the colonists, that really devastated the woodland wildflowers. we like to wring our hands about paving for interstates and new condominium projects today, but we needn't. the damage was done long ago when our ancestors cleared the eastern forests for farming. of course, there are relatively small habitats left, and in recent years, our forested area has been enlarging, and woodland wildflower habitat has been restored in many places. in any case, this elegant class of flowers, the trilliums, are now recognized as precious and special, although they are not officially endangered. in many areas, trilliums are still very common. wildflower gardeners love them, and it is true that most of them are not difficult to grow or transplant, and if conditions are good, they thrive. however, it does help to know the facts. here's how they are propagated. trilliums such as the great white spread very slowly by underground root stocks, and the seed produced creates new plants even more slowly. from a planted seed, it takes approximately five to nine years for a trillium grandiflorum plant ( the great white trillium ) to bloom. so when you see a massive drift of these in spring, you know you're looking at a bunch of plants that are at least a decade old, probably much older. these plants are not daisies! and how do they propagate themselves? well, t. grandiflorum is one of the wildflowers whose seeds are distributed by ants. yes, ants - - not birds or bees, or the wind, but ants. this is why the species creates large close drifts over the years. plants are never very far apart, since ants don't travel far. so each clump of t. grandiflorum you see was planted where you see it by an ant.

( they carry the seeds away when they fall from the plant because the ants enjoy the sticky covering each seed case has when it falls to the ground. ) that brings us to the basic rarity of the trilliums. a big factor is that each flower produces only one seed case when it fades. ( everybody knows that most flowers - - a daisy, for example, produces hundreds of loose seeds from each flower. ) so even if the ants find the sticky seed case, and take it underground where the several seeds inside can grow, there simply aren't huge numbers of white trillium seeds being planted each year. other trillium species have various propagation strategies, but all take years and years. now you have some idea of the value of these beautiful plants. they are an important part of american botanical history, and deserve a place of honor in every american wildflower garden. here are the best known species, with a little info on each : trillium grandiflorum, great white trillium. the provincial flower of ontario, and quite common there and around the great lakes. also the official wildflower of ohio, t. grandiflorum is native over most of the east, from canada to georgia, especially in neutral or non - acid soils. large white flowers fade to pink ;

( they carry the seeds away when they fall from the plant because the ants enjoy the sticky covering each seed case has when it falls to the ground. ) that brings us to the basic rarity of the trilliums. a big factor is that each flower produces only one seed case when it fades. ( everybody knows that most flowers - - a daisy, for example, produces hundreds of loose seeds from each flower. ) so even if the ants find the sticky seed case, and take it underground where the several seeds inside can grow, there simply aren't huge numbers of white trillium seeds being planted each year. other trillium species have various propagation strategies, but all take years and years. now you have some idea of the value of these beautiful plants. they are an important part of american botanical history, and deserve a place of honor in every american wildflower garden. here are the best known species, with a little info on each : trillium grandiflorum, great white trillium. the provincial flower of ontario, and quite common there and around the great lakes. also the official wildflower of ohio, t. grandiflorum is native over most of the east, from canada to georgia, especially in neutral or non - acid soils. large white flowers fade to pink ;

User > Mango Tree Leaves? In August my mango started dropping leaves, starting with the oldest. The leaves looked healthy, but the last few I took pictures of had brown edges down the sides. I have tried spraying with several different fungicides and it's still happening! All that's left now is the new growth from the tree being topped in October. I would so appreciate any help you could give me!

EVIDENCE:
Creeping plants, or "creepers," are generally considered to be small vining plants that grow close to the ground and often make good ground covers. They are also referred to as procumbent plants. Some of the fastest-growing creeping plants include creeping jenny, evening primrose, periwinkle, wintercreeper, English ivy, sweet woodruff, blue star creeper, and bugleweed. It's important to check whether you have any local restrictions against planting these creepers, as they are considered invasive in some areas due to their prolific growth. In cases where the vines are long enough, you can train creepers to grow up a support structure by attaching the stems to the structure with twine or another material. In this sense, creepers differ from "climbers," which are vines that tend to attach to structures on their own. Some plants with "creeper" in their name are vigorous climbers, including Virginia creeper and canary creeper. Creepers vs. climbers Creepers grow low to the ground Often produce long vines Can form good ground cover With spreading vines Climb via twining, clinging tendrils, and more Need human intervention to grow vertically on a support structure Generally capable of attaching themselves to a support structure Examples of creeping plants Many highly prized creeping plants are flowering ground covers. But some ground covers are grown for their leaves as much as for their blossoms. For example, creeping juniper (Juniperus horizontalis) is a ground-hugging shrub valued for its evergreen foliage and ability to curb erosion. Angelina stonecrop (Sedum rupestre 'Angelina') does flower, but most people don't grow it for the blooms. What gardeners adore about Angelina are its golden-chartreuse leaves. Similarly, spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum) is valued almost equally for its flowers and its variegated leaves. If you want creepers with showy flowers for your landscape, take a look at these plants: Creeping phlox (Phlox stolonifera) Creeping thyme (Thymus serpyllum) Bugleweed (Ajuga reptans) Creeping myrtle (Vinca minor) Dragon's blood sedum (Phedimus spurius 'Dragon's blood') Snow-in-summer (Cerastium tomentosum)

Title: 20 Common House Bugs to Know - What Insects Live in Houses?
##regate in the fall as they seek shelter for the winter. they can be found around baseboards, window and door moldings, openings for electrical outlets and fixtures, openings for heating or cooling vents, and other similar pathways. can it harm you? they do not bite or sting, but can gather in annoyingly large numbers within the home. what it looks like : while they look similar to your standard house fly, cluster flies are often larger, about ⅓ inch long. they are dull - gray and black and have golden - yellow hairs on their bodies, which give them a golden sheen and bristly texture. where you ’ ll find it : cluster flies head indoors to outlast the winter. you ’ ll likely find them in attics, under siding, and around windows and crevices on the outside of buildings. they also congregate between walls and work their way out through openings in window frames and electrical fixtures. can it harm you? cluster flies aren ’ t venomous and do not bite, don ’ t lay eggs in food like house flies, and aren ’ t associated with transmitting diseases. what it looks like : this creepy crawler get its name from its silvery scales and three, tail - like appendages that protrude from its abdomen. its antennae is as long as its body and can grow up to 12 mm in length. where you ’ ll find it : silverfish are known to feed on foods high in starches and destroy books, papers, wallpaper, and more. they are found in high - humidity environments, but are able to survive a wide range of temperatures. they usually hang out indoors in concealed, temperature - controlled areas such as bathrooms, attics, and basements. can it harm you? silverfish do not bite, do not have venom, and are not poisonous if ingested. what they look like : an adult bed bug can be anywhere from - ¼ - inch in size. “ they are often compared to the size of an apple seed, ” says nancy troyano, ph. d., a board - certified entomologist with western exterminator. bed bugs can range in color from a mahogany - red to light brown, “ depending on when they last fed, ” troyano says. where you ’ ll find them : in general, you ’ ll find them around people. “ blood is their only food source, ” says glen ramsey, a board - certified entomologist and senior technical services manager at orkin. bed bugs are normally nocturnal, and they ’ ll come out of hiding from places like a mattress to feed on sleeping or quietly resting people. keep in mind that bed bugs get around with the help of people, points out dan suiter, ph. d., professor of urban entomology at the university of georgia extension. “ if you find bed bugs in your home, you or someone you know who came to your home, brought them there from somewhere else, ” he says. “ they don ’ t just appear. ” can they harm you? yes. “ while bed bugs have not been found to transmit any diseases to humans, their bites may cause symptoms such as itching, red welts, or swelling the day after being bitten, ” ramsey says. however, “ many bites can leave no mark and go completely unnoticed. ” what it looks like : there are different types of cockroaches, but the most common are house cockroaches, also known as american cockroaches, which are about 2 inches long and have a reddish - brown color with a yellowish figure eight shape on their back. where you ’ ll find it : you ’ ll find them in your home in dark, moist areas, like basements, crawl spaces, and behind appliances. can it harm you? cockroaches can trigger allergies and asthma, and their feces and saliva can cause digestive issues in some people. what it looks like : wolf spiders are hunting spiders — and can be pretty big, up to an inch and a half long, marc potzler, a board - certified entomologist and technical services manager with ehrlich pest control, told prevention. they are usually black, gray, or brown, and have a hairy appearance. where you ’ ll find them : after mating in the fall, female wolf spiders look for protected areas to produce their egg cocoons. you ’ ll find them under and between boards, stones, firewood, and siding, most commonly in basements, sheds, or garages, where other insects are, says potzler. can it harm you? wolf spiders can bite, but only if they feel threatened. “ they would prefer to hide than bite, ” according to howard russell, m. s., an entomologist at michigan state university. cellar spider ( a. k. a. daddy long legs ) what it looks like : these are spindly spiders with long thin legs. the body of the cellar spider is usually 1 / 4 - 5 / 16 - inch - long, with legs extending another 2 inches. where you ’ ll find it : “ you ’ ll always find them in a corner with a cobweb, ” says raupp. their namesake matches their stomping grounds, including basements, attics, or other protected places. cellar spiders are known for their webbing, continuously adding to them. can it harm you? cellar spiders are not venomous and not known to bite. what it looks like : these crickets are light brown, tan, and dark brown with a humped back. they have very long antennae, and their bodies grow between 1 / 2 to 1 1 / 2 inches long. where you ’ ll find it : “ you ’ ll find them in the basement or dark mancave, ” says raupp, as they prefer dark, moist places. can it harm you? no. camel crickets do not bite and are not known to be harmful to humans and pets. what it looks like : when you think of a stereotypical cricket, these insects come to mind. camel crickets are light brown to dark brown in color, have very long antennae, and their bodies can grow up to 1 1 / 2 inches long. where you ’ ll find it : camel crickets prefer dark, moist places, such as basements and cellars. can it harm you? no. camel crickets do not bite and are not known to be harmful to humans and pets. what it looks like : ladybird beetles are tiny, oval, winged beetles that are usually between 1 to 10 millimeters ( mm ) in length, depending on the species. they are typically bright red with black spots. where you ’ ll find it : you can find them in your home in autumn, between september through november, when the temperatures drop and they seek a warm spot for winter. they like to gather together within crevices, like cracks around windows and door frames, soffits, attics, wall voids, and the area behind fascia boards and exterior siding. can it harm you? these beetles are believed to trigger allergies, ranging from eye irritation to asthma, potentially because they emit a stinky, yellow secretion when they feel they ’ re in danger. ladybird beetles may also bite ( it feels like a pinch ), but they are not poisonous and are rarely harmful. brown marmorated stink bug what it looks like : this invasive bug is large, as it can grow up to 2 centimeters long. “ when you look at its abdomen from the top, just around where its wings are, you ’ ll see a marbled pattern on its back, ” which is shield - shaped, says michael j. raupp, ph. d., professor of entomology at the university of maryland and creator of bug of the week. a brown marmorated stink bug also has distinct white bands on its antennae and legs, which distinguishes it from other native species that are also brown in color. where you ’ ll find it : you ’ ll spot these in your home from september through october — to find a protective spot as it gets colder. they ’ ll enter homes via windows, door cracks, vents, siding, shutters, loose siding — you name it. unfortunately, they congregate in masses, so getting rid of stink bugs can be annoying. can it harm you? besides the pungent odor they give off, stink bugs do not bite humans or pets, but they can do a number on your garden. what it looks like : fleas are tiny six - legged insects that typically get up to 2. 5 millimeters long, according to orkin. they range in color from brown to reddish - brown and are thin and flat with a little hair sticking out. fleas don ’ t have wings and can ’ t fly as a result. but they can jump from host to host. where you ’ ll find it : fleas usually travel into your home on a host, like a dog, versus walking in through the front door. once they ’ re inside, they like to take up residence in carpet, upholstery, and pet beds ( where they can have access to an easy meal ). adult fleas can live for months in your home when they ’ re exposed to a host, or die off within three weeks without one. can it harm you? technically, yes, fleas can harm you. the most likely issue you ’ ll experience is an allergic reaction to the flea ’ s saliva, according to gary goldenberg, m. d., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai hospital. if you scratch a flea bite, there ’ s also a risk that it could get infected. it ’ s less common but worth mentioning : fleas can technically transmit serious illnesses like typhus and the plague, according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ). but, again, you ’ re more likely to be uncomfortable from flea bites than get a serious disease. what it looks like : you ’ re probably familiar with house flies on some level, but it doesn ’ t hurt to cover them, just in case. a house fly is about ¼ - inches long, according to the illinois department of public health. it usually has four dark stripes in the middle of its body ( the thorax ). where you ’ ll find it : because they can fly nearly anywhere, house flies can be all over your home. however, they tend to gravitate toward trash and food, per the illinois department of public health. can it harm you? for the most part, you ’ ll usually be ok if there are a few house flies around your place — they ’ re super common, after all. but these flies have the ability to interfere with your food and possibly even make you sick. they feed on liquid food and have to liquify solid food by regurgitating saliva on it, according to the penn state extension. but they can leave waste around your home and are suspected to spread at least 65 diseases to people, including cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever, per penn state extension. while you don ’ t need to panic if you spot a house fly or two around your place, it ’ s a good idea to try to get rid of them or at least keep them away from your food. what it looks like : wolf spiders are hunting spiders — and can be pretty big, up to an inch and a half long, marc potzler, a board - certified entomologist and technical services manager with ehrlich pest control, told prevention. they are usually black, gray, or brown, and have a hairy appearance. where you ’ ll find it : after mating in the fall, female wolf spiders look for protected areas to produce their egg cocoons. you ’ ll find them under and between boards, stones, firewood, and siding, most commonly in basements, sheds, or garages, where other insects are, says potzler. can it harm you?

no. camel crickets do not bite and are not known to be harmful to humans and pets. what it looks like : ladybird beetles are tiny, oval, winged beetles that are usually between 1 to 10 millimeters ( mm ) in length, depending on the species. they are typically bright red with black spots. where you ’ ll find it : you can find them in your home in autumn, between september through november, when the temperatures drop and they seek a warm spot for winter. they like to gather together within crevices, like cracks around windows and door frames, soffits, attics, wall voids, and the area behind fascia boards and exterior siding. can it harm you? these beetles are believed to trigger allergies, ranging from eye irritation to asthma, potentially because they emit a stinky, yellow secretion when they feel they ’ re in danger. ladybird beetles may also bite ( it feels like a pinch ), but they are not poisonous and are rarely harmful. brown marmorated stink bug what it looks like : this invasive bug is large, as it can grow up to 2 centimeters long. “ when you look at its abdomen from the top, just around where its wings are, you ’ ll see a marbled pattern on its back, ” which is shield - shaped, says michael j. raupp, ph. d., professor of entomology at the university of maryland and creator of bug of the week. a brown marmorated stink bug also has distinct white bands on its antennae and legs, which distinguishes it from other native species that are also brown in color. where you ’ ll find it : you ’ ll spot these in your home from september through october — to find a protective spot as it gets colder. they ’ ll enter homes via windows, door cracks, vents, siding, shutters, loose siding — you name it. unfortunately, they congregate in masses, so getting rid of stink bugs can be annoying. can it harm you? besides the pungent odor they give off, stink bugs do not bite humans or pets, but they can do a number on your garden. what it looks like : fleas are tiny six - legged insects that typically get up to 2. 5 millimeters long, according to orkin. they range in color from brown to reddish - brown and are thin and flat with a little hair sticking out. fleas don ’ t have wings and can ’ t fly as a result. but they can jump from host to host. where you ’ ll find it : fleas usually travel into your home on a host, like a dog, versus walking in through the front door. once they ’ re inside, they like to take up residence in carpet, upholstery, and pet beds ( where they can have access to an easy meal ). adult fleas can live for months in your home when they ’ re exposed to a host, or die off within three weeks without one. can it harm you? technically, yes, fleas can harm you. the most likely issue you ’ ll experience is an allergic reaction to the flea ’ s saliva, according to gary goldenberg, m. d., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai hospital. if you scratch a flea bite, there ’ s also a risk that it could get infected. it ’ s less common but worth mentioning : fleas can technically transmit serious illnesses like typhus and the plague, according to the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ). but, again, you ’ re more likely to be uncomfortable from flea bites than get a serious disease. what it looks like : you ’ re probably familiar with house flies on some level, but it doesn ’ t hurt to cover them, just in case. a house fly is about ¼ - inches long, according to the illinois department of public health. it usually has four dark stripes in the middle of its body ( the thorax ). where you ’ ll find it : because they can fly nearly anywhere, house flies can be all over your home. however, they tend to gravitate toward trash and food, per the illinois department of public health. can it harm you? for the most part, you ’ ll usually be ok if there are a few house flies around your place — they ’ re super common, after all. but these flies have the ability to interfere with your food and possibly even make you sick. they feed on liquid food and have to liquify solid food by regurgitating saliva on it, according to the penn state extension. but they can leave waste around your home and are suspected to spread at least 65 diseases to people, including cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever, per penn state extension. while you don ’ t need to panic if you spot a house fly or two around your place, it ’ s a good idea to try to get rid of them or at least keep them away from your food. what it looks like : wolf spiders are hunting spiders — and can be pretty big, up to an inch and a half long, marc potzler, a board - certified entomologist and technical services manager with ehrlich pest control, told prevention. they are usually black, gray, or brown, and have a hairy appearance. where you ’ ll find it : after mating in the fall, female wolf spiders look for protected areas to produce their egg cocoons. you ’ ll find them under and between boards, stones, firewood, and siding, most commonly in basements, sheds, or garages, where other insects are, says potzler. can it harm you? wolf spiders can bite, but only if they feel threatened. “ they would prefer to hide than bite, ” according to howard russell, m. s., an entomologist at michigan state university. cellar spider ( a. k. a. daddy long legs ) what it looks like : these are spindly spiders with long thin legs. the body of the cellar spider is usually 1 / 4 - 5 / 16 - inch - long, with legs extending another 2 inches. where you ’ ll find it : “ you ’ ll always find them in a corner with a cobweb, ” says raupp. their namesake matches their stomping grounds, including basements, attics, or other protected places. cellar spiders are known for their webbing, continuously adding to them. can it harm you?

User > Japanese Maple Mystery Spots: We have a new Japanese Maple that was planted last fall. We have noticed white spots all over the trunk and main branches (see photos). What is this? Is it a problem, and if so what do we need to do to treat it? Also, it has a fair amount of lichen growing on it (also visible in photos). Should we do anything about this?

User > We have a Norfolk Island palm tree, and for many months, it has had new, recurring brown pine needles and dry branches. About a month ago, we treated the tree for spider mites by spraying the entire tree with a garden hose as well as with insecticidal soap. Although we never found spider mites on the tree, it had been adjacent to another plant that definitely had them. Now, the tree is still producing dried leaves and branches. We are requesting help on how to care for and treat our Norfolk Island palm tree. Some background information: our palm tree sits in a sunroom that is not climatized. It receives about 2 to 3 hours of morning sun every day. We used moisture-controlling soil and the pot includes a drainage hole; we water the plant every couple of days with copious amounts of water. The age of the tree is unknown, but we received it about a year and a half ago. Although there are dying branches and pine needles, the top of the tree is growing upward as seen in the picture.

"EVIDENCE:
Title: Weed Management in Lawns / Home and Landscape / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)
 
weeds can occur in all lawns but rarely become problems in well - managed, healthy turfgrass. poor maintenance practices — such as improper fertilization, watering, and mowing — can weaken turfgrass and make it susceptible to weed invasion. total eradication of weeds isn ’ t realistic or necessary for most lawns. with good management practices, a lawn can be vigorous and attractive with little or no herbicide use. why is weed identification important? - different weeds may require different management approaches. - many weed species are associated with lawn conditions, such as overwatering, compacted soil, or low fertility. identifying the weed species can give an indication of the underlying lawn care problem, which can be corrected. - for help identifying weeds, visit ipm. ucanr. edu. prevent weed invasions with proper lawn care. - choose a turfgrass species well adapted for your area or needs. - uniform water coverage is essential ; regularly check sprinkler heads and adjust if needed. - water deeply and infrequently. - when mowing, remove no more than one - third of the leaf blade. mowing height can vary depending on turfgrass species. - fertilize with 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1, 000 square feet per application up to 4 times a year. - heavy traffic can compact soil ; aerate the soil when grass is actively growing. - remove thatch if it is more than half an inch thick. - identify the weed species. - determine if there is an underlying lawn care problem such as improper fertilizing, watering, and mowing, and correct it. - remove weeds by hand when they are young and before they flower, set seed, form vegetative parts, or spread into patches. - overseed, patch, or renovate problem areas within the lawn. - before using an herbicide, address the underlying reason why weeds are invading. what about pesticides? - choose a selective herbicide that is labeled for use against your problem weed and can be used without damaging your turfgrass species. - nonselective herbicides can harm desirable turfgrass and other plants. - contact herbicides damage plant tissue but don't kill plant roots. these herbicides are most successful when applied to young weeds. - for more information on herbicides available for use on lawns, see the uc ipm pest notes : weed management in lawns. download a pdf of this quick tips. descargue un pdf de estos notas breves. pest notes : introduction weeds occur in every lawn, but they seldom become problems in well - managed, vigorously growing turfgrass. proper site preparation and turfgrass selection before planting are essential to give a new lawn a healthy start. once a lawn is established, poor maintenance practices that weaken it — such as improper irrigation, fertilization, or mowing — are the primary factors likely to predispose it to weed invasion. activities that lead to compaction also contribute significantly to turfgrass stress, making it easier for weeds to invade. an integrated weed management program can reduce most weed populations to tolerable levels and prevent large, unsightly weed patches. total eradication of weeds is not a realistic or necessary goal for most lawns and park turfgrass ; however, with proper maintenance a lawn can be practically free of weeds without the extensive use of chemicals. refer to the uc guide to healthy lawns ( see references ) for detailed information about turfgrass management practices. identifying weeds and knowing their life cycles are essential to management. three general categories of weeds may be found in lawns : broadleaves, grasses, and sedges. take care to distinguish weedy grasses from similar - looking lawn grass species. the life cycle of weeds may be annual, biennial, or perennial. annual weeds are commonly identified as either winter ( cool - season ) or summer ( warm - season ) annuals and survive only one season. if not controlled before they flower, they can produce seed that will sprout the following year or sometimes in the same growing season. in mild climates or in lawns that are influenced by microclimates, cool - season annuals may be found growing in summer ( or year - round ) and warm - season annuals may be found growing in winter ( or year - round ). biennial weeds survive for two growing seasons, reproducing vegetatively or by seed ; however, seed is not produced until the second year. perennial weeds survive for many years, and though they produce seeds, many primarily reproduce vegetatively by creeping stems ( stolons and rhizomes ), tubers, or fleshy roots. perennial weeds are the hardest to control once established. the most troublesome weed species in lawns are listed in table 1. for additional weeds, see the turfgrass weed photo gallery. weeds often invade turfgrass that is over - or under - watered, improperly fertilized, improperly mowed, or highly compacted. lawns that have been weakened by plant diseases or insect pests are also likely to become weedy because there is more open space for a weed to establish. most weed invasions can be prevented with proper lawn maintenance and good preventive practices or remedied with overseeding. the most troublesome weed species that invade turfgrass are often associated with specific conditions ( see table 1 ). identifying the weed species present may give an indication of the underlying problem responsible for the invasion and suggest what can be done to reduce the weed infestation. for detailed information about the major weed species listed in table 1, refer to the pest notes listed in references. weed management before planting a healthy lawn begins with a properly prepared site. before planting, remove existing vegetation and prepare the area for planting. if you expect annual weeds to be a problem, irrigate the site to allow weeds to germinate. follow up with a shallow cultivation or an application of a nonselective herbicide ( defined below ) such as glyphosate or clove oil, and repeat this process until the area is free of weeds. this is important when planting with seed or sod. perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. for perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules ( stems, rhizomes, and tubers ). it is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules are more easily removed. weed management after planting is also important. weeds can invade a new lawn at any time, but they are most likely to do so during the first year after planting. some weeds may be present in the seed or sod, and others may germinate from seed in the soil. weeds can also be introduced to the lawn through soil, water, or air. some weeds can be controlled by proper lawn care practices, such as proper mowing, watering, and fertilization. other weeds may require the use of herbicides. for more information on weed management in lawns, see the pest notes listed in references."

User > I believe the plant is called a Thunderhead. Starting in December, I noticed the tips of the thunderhead needles were browning. The plant has been in the container pot for 2 years. I'm hoping you can assess the cause of the browning and advise what action steps are needed to save the plant.

User > I recently diagnosed verticillium wilt in my backyard. The latest victim is a mature blue elderberry, which wilted suddenly last week during the warm weather. It lost about 80% of its canopy within a few days. In cross-section, the branches show black patches in the sapwood. After reading about verticillium wilt, I realize there have been signs of it in my yard for a few years: wilting branches on a flowering currant, tomatoes and peppers with blossom end rot, and a black elderberry that nearly died last year (but is looking okay so far this year, after severe pruning). I have a few questions regarding backyard verticillium wilt: - Is it safe to put branches and leaves from the infected elderberry into my city yard waste bin? I know home composts and worm bins don't get hot enough to kill the fungus. I live in town, so burning isn't a great option, and I'd rather not send it all to the landfill if that can be avoided. - Does the blossom end rot on my tomatoes and peppers look like verticillium wilt? The plants themselves seemed healthy. I grew them in newly-built raised beds filled with ~6 inches of commercial compost. - Is verticillium harbored in seeds? If so, is it a bad idea to save and plant seeds from my garden (peas, lupines, dahlias, etc.), even if the original plant appears healthy? - In terms of controlling the fungus, I will prune sick plants, sterilize garden tools, avoid moving soil around the yard, and try solarizing my raised beds if I see signs of infection again this year. Do you have any other advice?

and will start the cycle all over again. besides being long lasting in the soil, verticillium can spread in many ways. the most common way of spreading short distances is through root to root contact within the soil. roots in natural conditions often have small damages or openings in them that are easily colonized by verticillium from an infected root nearby. air borne conidia have been detected and some colonies observed, but mostly the conidia have difficulty developing above ground on healthy plants. [ 10 ] in open channel irrigation, v. dahliae have been found in the irrigation ditches up to a mile from the infected crop. without fungicidal seed treatments, infected seeds are easily transported and the disease spread, and verticillium has been observed remaining viable for at least 13 months on some seeds. planting infected seed potatoes can also be a source of inoculum to a new field. finally, insects have also been shown to transmit the disease. many insects including potato leaf hopper, leaf cutter bees, and aphids have been observed transmitting conidia of verticillium and because these insects can cause damage to the plant creating an entry for the verticillium, they can help transmit the disease. [ 3 ] [ edit ] while verticillium wilts often have the same symptoms of fusarium wilts, verticillium can survive cold weather and winters much better than fusarium, which prefers warmer climates. the resting structures of verticillium are able to survive freezing, thawing, heat shock, dehydration, and many other factors and are quite robust and difficult to get rid of. the one factor they do not tolerate well is extended periods of anaerobic conditions ( such as during flooding ). [ 3 ] verticillium will grow best between 20 and 28 degrees celsius, [ 2 ] but germination and growth can occur well below ( or above ) those temperatures. still, verticillium will generally not survive in the branches and trunks of infected trees during hot, dry seasons in regions such as summer in southern california. this does not generally \" cure \" the entire tree, however, and recurrence can happen via a reinfection from the roots during winter and spring. [ 11 ] water is necessary for resting structure germination, but is not as important for the spread of the fungus as in many other fungi. while not an environmental requirement for the fungus, stressed plants, often brought on by environmental changes, are easier to attack than healthy plants, so any conditions that will stress the plant but not directly harm the verticillium will be beneficial for verticillium wilt development. [ 3 ] [ edit ] verticillium wilt begins as a mild, local infection, which over a few years will grow in strength as more virile strains of the fungus develop. if left unchecked the disease will become so widespread that the crop will need to be replaced with resistant varieties, or a new crop will need to be planted altogether. [ 2 ] control of verticillium can be achieved by planting disease – free plants in uncontaminated soil, planting resistant varieties, and refraining from planting susceptible crops in areas that have been used repeatedly for solanaceous crops. soil fumigation can also be used, with chloropicrin being particularly effective in reducing disease incidence in contaminated fields. in tomato plants, the presence of ethylene during the initial stages of infection inhibits disease development, while in later stages of disease development the same hormone will cause greater wilt. tomato plants are available that have been engineered with resistant genes that will tolerate the fungus while showing significantly lower signs of wilting. [ 2 ] verticillium albo - altrum, v. dahliae and v. longisporum can overwinter as melanized mycelium or microsclerotia within live vegetation or plant debris. as a result, it can be important to clear plant debris to lower the spread of disease. v. dahliae and v. longisporum are able to survive as microsclerotia in soil for up to 15 years. [ 2 ] [ edit ] verticillium wilt occurs in a broad range of hosts but has similar devastating effects on many of these plants. in general, it reduces the quality and quantity of a crop by causing discoloration in tissues, stunting, and premature defoliation and death. [ 12 ] stock from infested nurseries may be restricted. once a plant is infected, there is no way to cure it. verticillium wilt is especially a concern in temperate areas and areas that are irrigated. verticllium spp. can naturally occur in forest soils and when these soils are cultivated, the pathogen will infect the crop. [ 2 ] the salinas valley in california has had severe problems with verticillium wilt since 1995, most likely due to flooding in the winter of 1995. many areas in the salinas and pajaro valleys are unable to grow lettuce due to the high levels of verticillium dahliae in the soil. [ 13 ] potatoes grown in verticillium infested soils may have a reduced yield between 30 – 50 % compared to potatoes grown in \" clean \" soil. verticillium wilt has also caused a shift in peppermint cultivation from the midwest in the mid - to late - 1800s to western states such as oregon, washington and idaho, to new, non - infested areas within these states now. [ 12 ] lists of plants susceptible or resistant [ edit ] replanting susceptible species on the site of a removed plant that has succumbed to v. albo - atrum or v. dahliae is inadvisable because of the heightened risk of infection. instead, resistant or immune varieties should be used. the following two lists show both susceptible and resistant / immune plants by latin name. [ 11 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] ( * ) indicates that the plant occurs on both lists because different varieties or cultivars vary in their resistance. ( # ) indicates that some strains are resistant. ( + ) indicates susceptibility to some european strains of verticillium albo - atrum.\",

be able to recover, or at least continue living with the infection. the severity of the infection plays a large role in how severe the signs are and how quickly they develop. [ 2 ] [ edit ] while verticillium spp. are very diverse, the basic life cycle of the pathogen is similar across species, except in their survival structures. the survival structures vary by species with v. albo - atrum forming mycelium, v. dahliae forming microsclerotia, v. nigrescens and v. nubilum forming chlamydospores, and v. tricorpus forming all three. while resting, many factors such as soil chemistry, temperature, hydration, micro fauna, and non - host crops all have an effect on the viability of the resting structure. mycelium have been observed remaining viable for at least 4 years, [ 4 ] while microsclerotia have been observed in fields planted with non - host crops for over 10 years [ 5 ] and even 15 years has been reported. [ 2 ] viability is reduced at these extremes, but the long survivability of these structures is an important aspect for verticillium control. when roots of a host crop come near the resting structure ( about 2mm ), [ 6 ] root exudate promotes germination and the fungi grows out of the structure and toward the plant. being a vascular wilt, it will try to get to the vascular system on the inside of the plant, and therefore must enter the plant. natural root wounds are the easiest way to enter, and these wounds occur naturally, even in healthy plants because of soil abrasion on roots. verticillium has also been observed entering roots directly, but these infections rarely make it to the vascular system, especially those that enter through root hairs. [ 7 ] once the pathogen enters the host, it makes its way to the vascular system, and specifically the xylem. the fungi can spread as hyphae through the plant, but can also spread as spores. verticillium produce conidia on conidiophores and once conidia are released in the xylem, they can quickly colonize the plant. conidia have been observed traveling to the top of cotton plants, 115 cm ( 45 in ), 24 hours after initial conidia inoculation, so the spread throughout the plant can occur very quickly. [ 8 ] sometimes the flow of conidia will be stopped by cross sections of the xylem, and here the conidia will spawn, and the fungal hyphae can overcome the barrier, and then produce more conidia on the other side. [ 9 ] a heavily infected plant can succumb to the disease and die. as this occurs, the verticillium will form its survival structures and when the plant dies, its survival structures will be where the plant falls, releasing inoculates into the environment. the survival structures will then wait for a host plant to grow nearby and will start the cycle all over again. besides being long lasting in the soil, verticillium can spread in many ways. the most common way of spreading short distances is through root to root contact within the soil. roots in natural conditions often have small damages or openings in them that are easily colonized by verticillium from an infected root nearby. air borne conidia have been detected and some colonies observed, but mostly the conidia have difficulty developing above ground on healthy plants.

User: Please identify the worms in my home compost. I am afraid to use this compost in my yard and riparian area until I know these worms are not invasive. I think they’re red wigglers, but I'm not sure they won’t cause issues in the native environment. Is this compost safe to add around a large old Elderberry bush/tree in sandy soil about 75 feet from the river?

Title: Red Wiggler Composting Worms: Everything You Need to Know

. the castings eventually pass through the anus at the end of the worm as capsules coated with a biologically - rich mucus. ( you ’ re not eating i hope. ) reproduction and life cycle of a red wiggler red wigglers, like all earthworms, are hermaphroditic, simultaneously possessing both male and female sex organs, both of which are used in the reproduction process. two worms of the same species will intertwine around each other ’ s clitella, secreting sperm through their skin, eventually producing a cocoon. this cocoon will normally yield 3 worms and each pair of worms will produce 1 - 3 cocoons per week. this lemon - shaped cocoon is about 1 / 8th inch wide, and starts as a yellowish color. it gets progressively darker until it hatches 21 days later. within 42 days, these baby worms will reach sexual maturity as evidenced by the emergence of the clitellum. a mature red wiggler can be expected to live between one to three years. why red wigglers are the king of composting worms the mighty red wiggler may sometimes be used as a bait worm for smaller fish or as a protein source for chickens and reptiles. but its main use is for – of course – vermicomposting. and as mentioned above, they are the most common composting worm in the world. well there ’ s probably not just one reason. rather, a combination of cost, hardiness, and comfort in a wide range of temperatures makes it the most appropriate composting worm for most new vermicomposters. hardiness and temperature tolerance red wigglers are a resilient composting worm, tolerant of a wider range of temperature than other species. for instance, its larger cousin, the european nightcrawler prefers cooler temperatures in the high - 60°f range. african nightcrawlers, on the other hand, prefer warmer temperatures between 77°f and 86°f. the red wiggler can tolerate both the low and high ends of these ranges, reproducing and processing organic waste well between 55°f - 90°f. they will survive – although maybe not thrive in – temperatures well below 50°f. its cocoons are famously hardy as well, able to withstand prolonged freezing temperatures, staying viable in a suspended state until they are able to hatch in warmer weather. thanks to its adaptability to different climates and ability to reproduce quickly in them, the cost of red wigglers is consistently lower than european nightcrawlers and significantly lower than the african nightcrawler. but red wigglers are nobody ’ s idea of cheap, and the skyrocketing demand for all things garden - related due to the covid pandemic of 2020 boosted prices of all composting worms. you can expect to pay at least $ 52 for one pound of red wigglers with shipping included in the continental us. as shipping two pounds is not significantly more expensive than shipping one pound, buying 2 pounds often provides the best value. the amount you buy, however, should be dictated by the available surface area of your worm bin. for most commercial worm bins, 1lb is sufficient, but 2 lbs will get you off to a faster start with your waste processing. if buying in bulk, it ’ s possible to buy for less than $ 35 per pound when buying 10 lbs or more. but most us suppliers are unable to fulfill large orders. red wiggler ownership : what you need to know about ordering, maintaining, and feeding ordering red wigglers online there ’ s nothing cosmic about ordering worms online, but i highly recommend you either build a diy bin or assemble your purchased commercial worm bin ( hopefully the urban worm bag! ) before you order your worms. you never know what problems or delays you may encounter with your worm bin, so it ’ s helpful to get it set up first to ensure you get off to a good start. how and when red wigglers get shipped when you do finally order your worms, it is likely that they will not ship until the following monday or tuesday. this is a common practice among worm shippers who don ’ t want to risk having the worms sit in a hot or cold warehouse over the weekend. worm growers are not storing worms in a situation where they are ready to ship. the worms must be harvested from their habitat first, so growers will often set a friday or saturday deadline in order to harvest in time for a monday shipment. as shipping live animals requires special permission from ups or fedex, almost all worm sellers ship via usps priority. you will see us ship via usps or ups. worms are typically packed in dry peat moss, not a living habitat. this reduces weight, but more importantly, the risk of microbial activity raising the temperatures to deadly levels while the worms are in transit. interestingly enough, significantly longer distances do not necessarily mean significantly longer transit times. monday shipments from the east coast often reach california customers on wednesday or thursday, and vice versa. but transit times are dependent upon the efficiency of the us postal service in your area. your shipping boxes are likely too large to fit in a mailbox, which is a good thing as a summertime shipment would be doomed in a hot, poorly - ventilated mailbox. so make sure that your postman is directed to leave your shipment in a shaded, protected environment if you won ’ t be home to receive your worms. where to buy red wigglers you can order from a number of online resellers, us included! but if you ’ re ordering from petsmart, petco, walmart, or another large company that is not directly related to the vermicomposting world, be careful! these worms will be a ) expensive and in small quantities and b ) quite possibly not eisenia fetida or composting worms at all. to save on shipping cost, you may want to see if there are any nearby “ mom and pop ” stores through a google search. if you don ’ t find what you ’ re looking for, then i invite you to check out worms through the urban worm company! how many red wigglers should you buy? the amount of red wigglers you buy should be solely dependent upon the surface area you have available for vermicomposting. as a rule of thumb, you should buy 1 / 2 to 1lb of composting worms per square foot of vermicomposting surface area. for most commercial worm bins, 1lb is sufficient, but 2 lbs will get you off to a faster start with your waste processing. if buying in bulk, it ’ s possible to buy for less than $ 35 per pound when buying 10 lbs or more. but most us suppliers are unable to fulfill large orders. red wiggler ownership : what you need to know about ordering, maintaining, and feeding ordering red wigglers online there ’ s nothing cosmic about ordering worms online, but i highly recommend you either build a diy bin or assemble your purchased commercial worm bin ( hopefully the urban worm bag!

 ### Created new session: rag_session_#799488

User > In Northeast DC, I moved into a house last August and inherited about a dozen different rosebushes. I’ve encountered a few issues with them: 1. One very small one in the front yard (possibly a Knock Out) looks like it may have rose rosette. I unknowingly pruned off the shriveled red foliage while deadheading. Could it be rosette? Should I remove the bush or did I risk spreading it to the adjacent bush after pruning? 2. In the backyard, three unknown variety bushes behaved differently. The large one bloomed well even when neglected, but the other two stopped blooming and lost foliage after an aphid treatment. The leaves also have dark spots—is it black spot? The re-emerging blossoms and leaves have bare stems and dark spots. Is the webbing a sign of pest or beneficial insects? Should I remove discolored leaves or webbing, or prune any bare stems now or in winter?

Title: Rose: Identify and Manage Problems | University of Maryland Extension
\n\nTips for diagnosing plant problems\n\nThe majority of plant problems are not caused by a disease or an insect, especially if the plant has been in your landscape for less than two years.\n\nThe presence of an insect or disease may not be the cause of the problem. Sometimes pests will take advantage of damaged or declining plants or the damage may have occurred way before you noticed it.\n\nIt is okay to tolerate some plant damage. For example, many fungal leaf spots cause cosmetic damage. Unsightly leaves can be simply pruned off the plant.\n\nPoor growing conditions, incorrect care, weather extremes, and soggy soil are the major cause of plant decline.\n\nBecome familiar with normal plant characteristics throughout the year.\n\nThere are numerous parasitoids and predators that keep insect pests under control.\n\nUse a pesticide only as a last resort and apply with care. First, identify the pest or disease and select low-toxicity products."

repair the bare areas 4 ) irregular random patches that appear after mowing cause : spilt petrol and oil can kill grass remedy : avoid topping up fuel or checking oil levels on your mower when it ’ s on the lawn, and be careful not to overfill the fuel tank or exceed the recommended oil levels. fuel may also spill out when tipping up a mower to check or unclog the blades. to repair the damaged patches, see our guide to repairing lawns animal and insect problems 1 ) dead patches that spread rapidly, often in conjunction with birds pecking the lawn surface cause : this suggests that insects are feeding on the grass roots remedy : leatherjackets and chafer grubs are the most likely culprits 2 ) circular patches with bright green margins on lawns that dogs have access to cause : dog urine – particularly female dog urine – can damage grass remedy : water the affected areas immediately. before feeding your dog any products that claim to prevent damage, consult your vet 1 ) dead or discoloured patches that spread rapidly, often during damp weather cause : fungal diseases and moulds mainly strike in wet weather, particularly in late summer, autumn and winter remedy : see the following advice pages on common lawn diseases : lawn rust, red thread, fusarium patch or snow mould, fairy rings, take - all patch and slime moulds on lawns 2 ) dark green followed by brown patches with no recovery after rain cause : these are a bit of a mystery, but the presence of water - repellent fungi appears to be a major factor remedy : rewetting the soil, although this can be tricky – see our advice on dry patch

Title: Weed Management in Lawns / Home and Landscape / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)

per 1, 000 square feet per application. see practical lawn fertilization for requirements for specific turfgrass species. regular thatch removal will help keep your turfgrass healthy and competitive with weeds. thatch is a layer of organic matter ( stems, stolons, roots ) that develops between the turfgrass blades and the soil surface. a thin layer of thatch is normal and even beneficial ; it can help limit weed germination. some turfgrass species, particularly warm - season creeping grasses, develop thick thatch layers that can prevent the circulation of air, water, and nutrients in the soil. generally, you should dethatch your lawn when the thatch layer is more than 1 / 2 inch thick. for some species, such as zoysiagrass, bermudagrass, or kentucky bluegrass, this may mean dethatching every year. for other species, such as tall fescue, dethatching may only be needed every 5 years or not at all. use a thatching rake on small lawns to loosen the layer of thatch. on creeping - type grass lawns, such as bermudagrass, use a verticutter or dethatcher to cut through the lawn to the soil surface. heavy traffic can compact soil over time. soil compaction restricts the flow of oxygen, water, and nutrients into the roots, causing the turfgrass to grow slowly and making it more susceptible to weed invasions. alleviate soil compaction with regular aeration. lawns on heavy clay soils or lawns with heavy foot or equipment traffic may need to be aerated several times a year while lawns with little activity may only need to be aerated once a year or less. aerators, sometimes called aerifiers, remove small cores of soil or create pores or channels in the rooting zone. a hand - held aerifier may be adequate on small lawns. for larger areas, machine - driven aerifiers are more practical and can be found at equipment rental businesses. aerate when the turfgrass is actively growing. be aware that aeration will leave temporary holes in the turf that will gradually fill in within a few weeks ; however some weed seeds may germinate in the spaces during that time. soil cores are usually left on the lawn surface and quickly break down with irrigation ; however some soil cores may contain weed seeds. in lawns that are known to be weedy, a preemergence herbicide application should be considered following aeration. controlling occasional weeds by hand pulling may be all that is necessary if you practice regular and proper maintenance procedures. hand weeding is particularly important for preventing infestations of creeping woodsorrel ( oxalis ), nutsedge, dandelion, spurge, dallisgrass, and bermudagrass. remove weeds while they are still young and before they set seed or produce rhizomes or tubers. remove small patches before they get large. making this a regular habit will greatly reduce the number of weeds in your lawn. be sure to remove the entire weed, including the root. a dandelion fork or fishtail weeder is useful for removing weeds with a thick taproot. larger patches can be dug out and the holes filled with clean soil. if your lawn is properly maintained, herbicides will generally not be necessary. when they are needed, use them as part of an integrated management program that includes good cultural maintenance practices. no single herbicide will control all lawn weeds, and not all herbicides can be used on all lawn species. you must identify your weed problem ( s ) and turfgrass species before choosing an herbicide. a few of the most serious lawn weeds, such as some perennial grasses, cannot be effectively controlled with herbicides without killing the turfgrass as well. the products mentioned here are primarily for residential lawns. professional turf managers who are licensed pesticide applicators should also review the uc ipm pest management guidelines for turf. herbicides are classified in several ways : - preemergent or postemergent - contact or systemic - selective or nonselective. preemergence herbicides are applied before weeds emerge from the soil ; they kill weed seedlings as they germinate and try to emerge. in lawns they are primarily used against annual grass weeds such as annual bluegrass and crabgrass, but there are also preemergence herbicides that are effective against many broadleaf weeds. postemergence herbicides are applied after weeds have emerged from the soil ; they control actively growing weeds. postemergence herbicides may have either contact or systemic activity. contact herbicides cause localized injury where the chemical comes in contact with the plant and are most successful when applied to young weeds. examples include diquat, carfentrazone, plant oils and herbicidal soaps. in contrast, systemic herbicides move within the plant, causing injury at additional sites in the plant and can control older weeds. examples include glyphosate, quinclorac, triclopyr, or 2, 4 - d, dicamba, and mecoprop mixtures ( active ingredients in many broadleaf weed killers ). selective herbicides kill target weeds without damaging desirable turfgrass species. they are toxic to only certain plants or weeds. for example, 2, 4 - d selectively kills only broadleaf plants and not grasses ; fluazifop selectively kills only grasses and not broadleaf plants. nonselective herbicides kill all or most vegetation including turfgrass. they should only be used prior to planting a lawn, during renovation, or as spot treatments. examples of nonselective postemergence herbicides include diquat ( a contact herbicide ), plant oils ( contact herbicides ), and glyphosate ( a systemic herbicide ). the herbicide you choose will depend on the types of weeds you are trying to control and the tolerance of your turfgrass species. table 2 lists some common herbicides and brand names labeled for use on residential turfgrass lawns or for turfgrass renovation and highlights the types of weeds or special weed problems they control. please note that some of the pesticides mentioned here are available for professional use only, but can be applied on residential lawns. * these are example trade names and not all trade names are listed. trade names and registrations change frequently. not all listed products may currently be registered. although herbicide products containing fertilizers

Title: Fraylick Farm - What's Eating My Dahlias- Part 2

what's eating my dahlias - part 2 dahlias are gorgeous! unfortunately all the bugs think so too. let ’ s talk about how to deal with some of the most common pests : grasshoppers, thrips, tarnished plant bug ( tpb ), cucumber beetles, and leafhoppers. these methods work well for the home gardener and small scale grower. i use organic pest control methods. there are plenty of other options out there but i choose organic on our farm so that ’ s what you ’ ll find covered here. let ’ s start with the most full proof pest control method : prevent the pest from even touching your dahlia. this is accomplished by the use of organza bags — you know the kind they use for wedding favors. these work extremely well for a cut flower operation or cut flower specific garden. they block everything from getting your blooms. however if you are enjoying your dahlias in a backyard garden style setting, you may not want to look at “ dahlia lollipops ” all the time. kinda ’ diminishes the joy of it. grasshoppers are the hardest to control in my opinion. there aren ’ t many organic sprays that will touch a hard bodied insect. the best control for a grasshopper that i ’ ve found is attracting birds to your garden. birds love to eat grasshoppers. adding a water source, even a small one, is a great way to attract birds. if you have chickens, even better - they will devour them. just make sure your plants are big enough to take a little chicken abuse. usually grasshoppers don ’ t become a menace until the plants are blooming so at that point, allowing chickens into your dahlia patch can work. i used to use this method a lot until a fox got all our chickens. botanigarde maxx is the only spray i ’ ve ever encountered that will kill a grasshopper and even it ’ s hit or miss — grasshoppers move quickly so it ’ s hard to get the spray on them. if grasshoppers are a serious issue for you, consideration of the organza bag will have to be done. it ’ s the most effective method for grasshopper control. thrips are an annoying nemesis when it comes to dahlias. timing is one of the best methods i ’ ve found for dealing with them. in my climate, thrips are a bad issue from mid - may to mid summer. then they die back and aren ’ t found in high infestation level numbers. thrips are probably the number one reason i don ’ t grow early season dahlias. organza bags are reasonably effective against them but thrips are so small that they can get inside the bags sometimes. various sprays will work on them and keep the populations under control but having perfect light colored dahlias is a challenge during thrip season. if you need dahlias during thrip season, stick with brighter colors - thrips are more attracted to whites / light colors. a pyrethrin spray or a spinosad spray is a pretty effective tool against thrips. i highly recommend alternating what you spray. also one round of spraying won ’ t cut it, it ’ s something you have to do regularly during the pest ’ s season. tarnished plant bugs and leafhoppers - these 2 can be controlled by the same method. the

Title: Red Wiggler Composting Worms: Everything You Need to Know

ding. if needed, ground eggshells and agricultural lime can be used to offset the the generally more acidic fruit and vegetable waste. unless you only feed acidic food waste, which will cause all sorts of other problems, ph is likely going to be the least of your concerns when it comes to maintaining your red wigglers feeding your red wigglers red wigglers don ’ t need a different diet than any other composting worm, but the following point can ’ t be stressed enough ; a properly - maintained worm bin will need regular additions of bedding along with food waste. worm bedding, unlike bedding for reptiles, hamsters and other animals, will ultimately be consumed by the worms as it breaks down. in this respect, carbon - rich bedding is a “ slow food ” where food waste is a “ fast food. ” and when feeding your red wigglers, we recommend a 2 : 1 ratio of bedding to food waste, by volume. in other words, if you ’ ve got a handful of food waste, add at least two handfuls of bedding. but when choosing the fast foods for your red wigglers, stay away from meat - or dairy - based products. otherwise, you ’ ve got plenty of options in front of you. within reason, most fruits and vegetables are fair game and your red wigglers will be thrilled with them. want to learn more about the soil food web? actinomycetes are “ characters ” in what we know as the soil food web. check out what everyone else does in our comprehensive post about what else is under your feet. summary : the ford taurus of composting worms there are excellent vermicomposting worms that you can choose from. the european nightcrawler, the larger cousin of the red wiggler, is just as voracious and also makes for a good bait worm. but it prefers a bit of a cooler environment than the red wiggler. the african nightcrawler is a very large composting worm and makes a beautiful, granular cast. but it needs warmer temps than the eisenia fetida. the indian blue is voracious, but also prefers a warmer climate and it also exhibits a tendency to escape the bin. the red wiggler is a hardy worm and isn ’ t as picky about its climate. i like to call it the ford taurus of vermicomposting worms ; you won ’ t brag to your hardcore composting buddies that you own them, but they will serve you well. they are simply the most appropriate worm for the widest range of circumstances. if you ’ re just getting started with vermicomposting and in need of some mighty red wigglers or you need a “ top off ” for your bin, i ’ d love for the urban worm company to earn your business!

User > What is happening to my 25 year old English Boxwood plants? I used to have eight plants. I have one full one and three partial ones left. I have been given various explanations: they don't like the exposure, there are funguses in the ground, there are insects, and they are not getting enough air because of the way they are trimmed. The plants die off over 6 - 10 months. Small wedges turn yellow. Then the leaves die. I can clip the dying part out but there is never any sign of regrowth on the stubs of the stem. They are along the edge of the front door path. I don't use any de-ice products on the path. Crocuses, grape hyacinths and violets do fine under the shrubs. I have used hardwood mulch in the past but none this year. Can you help please?

Hello Geraldine, happy to help.
Sorry to see that damage on your pine. The needles will not return, unfortunately. The damage is purely aesthetics, though, and your shrub will live and continue to grow and fill out where the branches are untouched. Also, rabbits can't reach any farther than they can stand up but keep in mind the snow pack can extend their reach.
It's really up to you whether to remove it or not. Some creative options include planting a low growing perennial like Siberian irises around your pine to hide the damage during the growing season.
If you should decide to keep the shrubs, I recommend setting up a chicken wire fence around them in the fall and removing the snow around them when you shovel your walk so the rabbits don't gain access as the snow piles up."

User > The bark of a young Red Maple (10-12 years) at the local park has peeled off from the first tree branch height to the ground (6"w x 5' h). The bark is attached but laying at the base of the tree, looking as though someone peeled it from the top down. Is there anything I can do to help the tree?

Title: How to Identify and Treat Maple Bark Diseases and Afflictions
plant – all of which occurs mostly during the summer months. symptoms include a streaked and radiating stain in the trunk and roots, along with stunted leaf growth and gradual branch dieback. the progression of symptoms will eventually culminate in the plant ’ s death three to four years after the onset of infection. because the stain is internal, the disease has a high potential of going unnoticed until after the tree dies. prevention is all you can do for your maples when it comes to sapstreak, as there is no known cure. avoid inflicting wounds to the trunk and roots, and make sure to avoid summertime logging, as that ’ s a prime time for this disease to spread. remove trees as they become infected to prevent further spread throughout the grove or landscape. 7. sooty bark disease like sapstreak, sooty bark disease is caused by a fungal pathogen – cryptostroma corticale, to be exact. the fungus makes its way into a maple ’ s heartwood – the dense, nonliving wood at the core of a tree ’ s sapwood – after infiltrating and killing smaller branches. once it reaches the core of the tree, it spreads up and down the trunk, eventually traveling outwards to the bark. and when it has arrived, the disease blisters and kills the bark, along with producing dark, sooty - looking, spore - producing masses directly under the bark, hence the name. additional symptoms include dead twigs that often appear on a single side of the tree, trunk cankers, leaf wilt, soft rot, and the eventual death of infected maples. it ’ s important to scout out potential planting spots for signs of this disease such as black mold underneath nearby trees – it could save you a lot of hassle. if sooty bark disease prevention is a high - priority goal of yours, avoid pruning healthy trees during dry summer conditions, since sunburned bark is a prime entry point for c. corticale. if you find an infected tree, remove it and burn it, making sure to keep all parts covered during any necessary transportation from one area of the landscape to another. the best time to do this is during the rainy months, as this disease spreads the most in hot and dry weather conditions. as a pale white dude in missouri who loves being outside, i know a thing or two about damage from the sun. with every sunburn i receive, it feels as if my genetics are screaming at me to seek shelter, or refrain from going outside unless it ’ s gray and cloudy out. all of this to say : whenever i see a tree with sunscald, i truly feel for it. sunscald occurs when high temperatures and harsh sun exposure cause severe bark damage. it ’ s commonly seen on the trunks of young trees that have yet to develop enough durability to withstand the sun ’ s rays. early symptoms include reddish - brown, canker - esque discoloration and slight vertical cracks in the bark. damaged areas may bleed sap in springtime. as the damage progresses, the cracks will turn into fissures and the bark will start to exfoliate, peeling off of the trunk. a typical strategy for preventing sunscald is to cover juvenile trunks with a lightly - colored and ideally quick - drying material for blocking harsh rays. common materials include light brown kraft paper, white fabric, or corrugated plastic tree guards. these covers will need to be left in place until the bark on the trunk has matured sufficiently or until the tree ’ s canopy is large enough to provide ample shade – both of which could take several years. other than cutting away exfoliated bark, there ’ s not much you can do for trees that have already been damaged by sunscald. proper care for an injured tree involves the same practices and methods that you would use for a perfectly healthy specimen, and you can read more about these in our guide to growing maples. hundred - foot rolls of brown kraft paper made from 100 percent recycled material are available via amazon. 9. trunk suffocation mulch can be very beneficial, don ’ t get me wrong – but only in goldilocks amounts. if your maple looks like it ’ s growing out of a volcano made of mulch, then you ’ ve piled it on a bit too thick and placed it too close to the trunk. too much mulch that ’ s piled on essentially suffocates the lower trunk, which leads to the death of inner bark tissue, which limits nutrient transport through the phloem. this weakens roots, leaving them malnourished and unable to take up resources for the tree, which leads to aboveground plant problems. a massive mound of mulch around the trunk also creates a moist entry point for pathogens and pests to infiltrate the now - decaying inner bark tissue. plus, it can easily overheat, which can prevent necessary cold - hardening come wintertime … or it may straight - up cook the inner bark of the tree in the summer, killing it in the process. to mulch properly, apply two to four inches – less for fine - textured materials, more for coarse textures – in mid - spring, spread in a three - to five - foot radius out from the trunk. make sure to keep the mulch two inches away from the trunk and root flares. maple bark disease : beat it with ease when it comes to plant care, learning about diseases and other health issues not caused by infectious pathogens is half of the battle. when you know what causes a disease or affliction, preventing it is simple. when you find out what cures an illness, fixing the problem is that much easier. maple bark may take second fiddle to the foliage, but it ’ s still an important part of the symphony, aesthetics - wise. now that you ’ re able to keep it healthy, you can rest easy, knowing that your maple tree ’ s full glory is within reach, and your plant is firing on all cylinders. any questions, remarks, or insightful in - the - trenches experiences can go into the comments section below. and if you ’ re now jonesing for some more maple guides, get your fix with these articles next :

when it comes to maple trees, the foliage gets all the attention … and why wouldn ’ t it? in addition to having an iconic shape and providing bountiful shade from the sun, acer leaves reveal beautiful shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. a maple ’ s foliage is arguably its best feature. but the bark of a maple plays an ornamental supporting role to the leaves, taking center stage once the defoliated trees go dormant. we link to vendors to help you find relevant products. if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. with smooth bark that roughens and fissures to create interesting textures with age, acer bark is a gorgeous part of the tree that is often overlooked. unfortunately, this beautiful bark isn ’ t immune to harm. whether it ’ s due to a disease, environmental condition, or just faulty cultivation, there are some afflictions that can really take a toll on your trees. in this guide to identifying and treating maple bark diseases, we ’ ll cover the main threats you should keep an eye out for, how to treat these issues when they come up, and even how to prevent them from occurring in the first place. here ’ s a quick peek at the potential bark issues that we ’ ll cover up ahead : 9 common maple bark afflictions 1. burr knots and galls both burr knots and galls look like strange, sickly - looking lumps on tree trunks or branches … but there ’ s a bit more to them than that. burr knots actually form from small adventitious roots or bud tissues that don ’ t quite form shoots, and tend to grow in warm, humid conditions. they grow larger and more knotted as the tree matures. although they may look less than attractive on the tree, burr knots are actually prized by woodworkers for the unique swirls and patterns that they contain. galls, on the other hand, could be more accurately described as tumors, since they ’ re usually caused by bacteria or infectious material left behind by pests. the infectious agent spurs the gall to grow uncontrollably, and a gall can range in size from a half - inch to more than a foot in diameter. burr knots can easily break in frosty or windy conditions, provide easy access points for pests and pathogens, and even limit the flow of nutrients through the phloem if they manage to grow together in a mass of multiple knots. galls also block nutrients from flowing throughout the plant, in addition to looking even more contorted and irregular than burr knots. both burr knots and galls leave plant growth compromised as they block the healthy movement of nutrients. this tends to manifest as stunted growth or overall decline. to prevent burr knots, it ’ s imperative to keep the trunk dry. avoid growing vegetation under the canopy, or wrapping your trunk in a tree guard of any kind. skipping the former will prevent adjacent evapotranspiration from moistening your tree, while the latter will allow your tree to remain aired out and dry. if it ’ s too late for preventive care, feel free to cut out burr knots, as long as there are only a few of them. hey, maybe you ’ ll end up with some cool lumber to use in woodworking! galls are best prevented by avoiding injury to your trees and managing pests. you can cut them out if they ’ re already present on your

. in general, lichens from each group appear in various sizes and shapes, and tree - dwelling types as a whole tend to sport shades of pale blue or green. they ’ re commonly found on the bark of trees, with different species finding certain bark textures easier to adhere to than others. since lichens prefer full sun exposure, health issues resulting in any degree of defoliation for the tree will increase a lichen ’ s chances of surviving and thriving on your maple. therefore, if lichen elimination for aesthetics is the goal, it ’ s essential to try to prevent or resolve any infections, infestations, or poor cultivation practices that could compromise the leaves. unfortunately, lichens can also grow on healthy specimens and there aren ’ t any chemical treatments available that will solely target the lichen. furthermore, removal by hand will result in excessive damage to the trunk. but in general, they can be indicative of an unhealthy tree that ’ s vulnerable to disease or insects, and they can also attract large animals such as deer or caribou that like to feed on lichens. the resources that these organisms take from the tree are miniscule, but definitely warrant action for those who want to cultivate a tree that ’ s entirely free of stress. thankfully, a clump or two of lichen isn ’ t the most unaesthetic thing that could happen to the trunk of your maple tree. plus, a lichen ’ s presence is often indicative of good air quality! tiny organisms and exposures to extreme temperatures aren ’ t the only stressors that can damage a maple tree ’ s bark. lightning strikes, severe winds, animal damage, and even climbing children can do a number on the trunk and branches of an acer via physical damage. if the damage is to a branch, you ’ ll need to prune it off with a sterilized tool such as a saw or a pair of loppers. make the cut below a node or just above the branch collar, depending on whether the branch is salvageable or not. in the case of bark damage, trim away any ragged or torn pieces so that healing sans infection can begin. sapstreak is a disease which primarily afflicts sugar maple trees, so i ’ m especially passionate about this one. any sickness that could leave my waffles unsweetened demands my full attention. caused by the fungus ceratocystis virescens, sapstreak is a fatal disease which enters wounds in a sugar maple ’ s trunk or root system. typically, this mostly affects the cut logs or stumps of a. saccharum trees planted as a part of a sugar maple stand – although the disease can affect living trees, as well. this disease has the potential to wipe out large maple syrup operations, yet another threat to a sweet and syrup - glazed breakfast. the sticky c. virescens spores that cause sapstreak disease are vectored by insects such as sap beetles and fruit flies that carry the spores from plant to plant – all of which occurs mostly during the summer months. symptoms include a streaked and radiating stain in the trunk and roots, along with stunted leaf growth and gradual branch dieback. the progression of symptoms will eventually culminate in the plant ’ s death three to four years after the onset of infection. because the stain is internal, the disease has a high potential of going unnoticed until after the

Title: Fusicolla Orange Slime on Trees | Home & Garden Information Center
Infrequently in the spring, you might see an orange, slimy substance slowly oozing from a wound on a hardwood tree. This is a fungus or a complex of fungi and yeast that colonize the sap that leaks from a tree wound. The primary fungus involved that gives this slime its orange color is Fusicolla merismoides (formerly called Fusarium merismoides). Although this slime looks rather disgusting coming from your prize hardwood tree, it is actually harmless. It is very similar to wetwood or slime flux, which are caused by either bacteria or both bacteria and yeasts. The orange slime fungi are simply growing on the carbohydrates (sugars) and moisture in the sap, but they do not cause diseases of the tree’s wood or foliage. These fungi thrive in the spring as the sap is rising and leaking from wounds on tree trunks or limbs. During March of this year, a river birch at the State Botanical Garden in Clemson was found with a minor sap infection of Fusicolla orange slime. At least the color was Clemson orange!

EVIDENCE:
A truffle is the fruiting body of a subterranean ascomycete fungus, one of the species of the genus tuber. More than one hundred other genera of fungi are classified as truffles including geopora, peziza, choiromyces, and leucangium. These genera belong to the class pezizomycetes and the pezizales order. Several truffle-like basidiomycetes are excluded from pezizales, including rhizopogon and glomus. Truffles are ectomycorrhizal fungi, so they are found in close association with tree roots. Spore dispersal is accomplished through fungivores, animals that eat fungi. These fungi have ecological roles in nutrient cycling and drought tolerance. Some truffle species are prized as food. Edible truffles are used in Italian, French, and other national haute cuisines. Truffles are cultivated and harvested from natural environments. The black truffle or black perigord truffle (tuber melanosporum), the second-most commercially valuable species, is named after the perigord region in France. Black truffles associate with oaks, hazelnut, cherry, and other deciduous trees and are harvested in late autumn and winter. The genome sequence of the black truffle was published in March 2010. The black summer truffle (tuber aestivum) is found across Europe and is prized for its culinary value. Burgundy truffles (designated tuber uncinatum, but the same species) are harvested in autumn until December and have aromatic flesh of a darker color. These are associated with various trees and shrubs. Tuber magnatum, the high-value white truffle (Italian: tartufo bianco) is found mainly in the Langhe and Montferrat areas of the Piedmont region in northern Italy, and most famously, in the countryside around the cities of Alba and Asti. A large percentage of Italy's white truffles also come from Molise. The "whitish truffle" (tuber borchii) is a similar species native to Tuscany, Abruzzo, Romagna, Umbria, the Marche, and Molise. It is reportedly not as aromatic as those from Piedmont, although those from Citta di Castello are said to come quite close. A less common truffle is "garlic truffle" (tuber macrosporum). In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, several species of truffle are harvested both recreationally and commercially, most notably, Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon black truffle; tuber gibbosum, Oregon spring white truffle; and tuber oregonense, Oregon winter white truffle. Kalapuya brunnea, the Oregon brown truffle, has also been commercially harvested and is of culinary note. The Oregon white truffle is increasingly harvested due to its high quality and also exported to other countries. Oregon celebrates its traditional truffle harvesting with a 'truffle festival'. The first black truffles (tuber melanosporum) to be produced in the southern hemisphere were harvested in Gisborne, New Zealand in 1993. New Zealand's first burgundy truffle was found in July 2012 at a Waipara truffle farm. It weighed 330 g and was found by the farm owner's beagle. In 1999, the first Australian truffles were harvested in Tasmania, the result of eight years of work. Trees were inoculated with the truffle fungus to create a local truffle industry. Their success and the value of the resulting truffles has encouraged a small industry to develop. Truffle production has expanded into the colder regions of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. In 2014, over 5,000 kilograms (11,000 pounds) of truffles were harvested by Truffle Hill, Manjimup, Western Australia. In June 2014, a grower harvested Australia's largest truffle from their property at Robertson, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. It was a French black perigord fungus weighing in at 1.172 kg (2 lb 9 + 5⁄16 oz) and was valued at over $2,000 per kilogram. Perigord truffles were first farmed in Tennessee in 2007. At its peak in the 2008–2009 season, one farm produced about 200 pounds of truffles, but Eastern Filbert Blight almost entirely wiped out the hazel trees by 2013 and production dropped, essentially ending the business. Eastern Filbert Blight similarly destroyed the orchards of other once-promising commercial farms in East Tennessee, while newer farms in California, North Carolina, Oregon, and Arkansas were started. As of 2022 [update], the Appalachian truffle (tuber canaliculatum) was being developed as a potential market. Because of their high price and their strong aroma, truffles are used sparingly. Supplies can be found commercially as unadulterated fresh produce or preserved, typically in a light brine. Their chemical compounds infuse well with fats such as butter, cream, cheeses, avocados, and coconut cream. As the volatile aromas dissipate quicker when heated, truffles are generally served raw and shaved over warm, simple foods which highlight their flavour, such as buttered pasta or eggs. Thin truffle slices may be inserted into meats, under the skins of roasted fowl, in foie gras preparations, in pates, or in stuffings. Some speciality cheeses contain truffles, as well. Truffles are also used for producing truffle salt and truffle honey. While chefs once peeled truffles, in modern times, most restaurants brush the truffle carefully and shave it or dice it with the skin on to make the most of the valuable ingredient. Some restaurants stamp out circular discs of truffle flesh and use the skins for sauces. Truffle oil is used as a lower-cost and convenient substitute for truffles, to provide flavouring, or to enhance the flavour and aroma of truffles in cooking. Some products called "truffle oils" contain no truffles or include pieces of inexpensive, unprized truffle varietals, which have no culinary value, simply for show. The vast majority is oil that has been artificially flavoured using a synthetic agent such as 2,4-dithiapentane. The scientific name is included on the ingredient list of truffle oils infused with natural truffles. Because more aromatic molecules in truffles are soluble in alcohol, they can carry a more complex and accurate truffle flavour than oil without synthetic flavourings. Many commercial producers use 2,4-dithiapentane regardless, as it has become the dominant flavour most consumers, unexposed to fresh truffles but familiar with oils, associate with them. Because most western nations do not have ingredient labelling requirements for spirits, consumers often do not know if artificial flavourings have been used. It is used as a spirit in its own right, a cocktail mix or a food flavouring."

User: Hello! I was hoping someone might be able to help me identify my tree. My name is Chloe and I bought a house in August with a beautiful tree in the front that is one of the main reasons I bought the place. In the summer, the tree had some fluffy yellow pod-like poofs (technical term). I took photos of it today but I'm including a couple from the summer so that you might be able to see the foliage. There are still some seed pods on the branches in January. If you could help, that would be amazing. I am interested in general, but I am also taking a horticulture class and have an assignment to learn about one of the plants/trees in your yard and this seemed like a golden opportunity.

Title: Weeping Alaskan Cedar: An Elegant, Easy-to-grow Evergreen Tree
\n\nare very common in the nursery trade. - chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘ pendula ’ : this is the most common cultivar found for sale, especially in the eastern us. i have two in my pennsylvania garden, and they perform beautifully. the branches are even more pendulous on this selection, with the lower branches often touching the ground. it ’ s quite an elegant evergreen tree. this variety grows to 35 feet tall and 12 feet wide. - chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘ green arrow ’ : known commonly as the green arrow weeping alaskan cedar, this variety grows into a very narrow spire. with a height of 20 feet and a width of a mere 2 feet, ‘ green arrow ’ is the best selection for small yards and gardens, or for narrow areas along a driveway or fence. it creates a strong, vertical accent in the landscape. where to plant a weeping alaskan cedar because these beautiful trees grow so large and their graceful branches spread wide, don ’ t try to sandwich them into a small space ( unless of course you ’ re growing the small - space cultivar ‘ green arrow ’ ). give these trees plenty of room to show off. choose a site that receives full sun throughout most of the day. the ideal location should have moist soil, but not waterlogged. consistently moist soil is key, so if you have a low - lying area, this tree is a great choice. however, standing water is a big no - no. also try to choose a location that ’ s protected from harsh winter winds. strong winds can cause needle or branch desiccation and even die - back if winters are extremely cold and windy where you live. though the weeping alaskan cedar is very cold hardy, it does not do well in high - wind areas. problems with chamaecyparis nootkatensis thankfully, there are few problems that plague the weeping alaskan cedar. their pest resistance is yet another reason to love this tree. it has no serious pests in the landscape, though occasionally i find a bagworm or two clinging to the branches. upon occasion, spruce mites can be problematic. however, if you encourage a good population of beneficial insects in your garden by including lots of flowering plants, mite numbers seldom become an issue. the weeping alaskan cedar is also fairly tolerant of road - side pollution, though i suggest keeping it away from sidewalks, roads, and driveways that are routinely treated with road salt in the winter time. or, use a plant - and pet - safe ice melter to protect your plants from damage. caring for a weeping alaskan cedar thankfully, these trees need very little in terms of care and maintenance. - keep the plant mulched with a 2 - to 3 - inch layer of shredded hardwood mulch. this maintains consistent soil moisture and limits weed competition. do not pile mulch against the trunk of this or any other tree. - do not prune weeping alaskan cedars. just like pruning japanese maples, its lovely form is easily ruined by poor pruning technique. it ’ s best to give your weeping alaskan cedar all the room it needs. that means it will grow to its full size right from the start, and don ’ t prune it at all. - keep the tree well - watered until it ’ s established. if you site it according to its needs, once established, you won ’ t need to add any supplemental water except during periods of extreme drought. - fertilize weeping alaskan cedar trees every few years with an acid - specific granular organic fertilizer. an all - around great evergreen tree, the weeping alaskan cedar is well worth including in your garden. be sure you have the right conditions and site it properly. i hope you ’ ll consider making room for one of these beauties ; you ’ ll enjoy its gorgeous good looks for many years to come. to discover more great trees and shrubs for your garden, check out these related articles : - dwarf evergreen trees - the best trees for privacy - flowering trees : 21 of the best - evergreen compact shrubs what ’ s your favorite evergreen tree? we ’ d love to hear about it in the comment section below.\n\nTitle: Orange Fungus on Evergreens - Salisbury Greenhouse - Blog\n\nAll About Juniper-Hawthorne Rust\n\nWhile wet weather makes for lush gardens, it can also create the perfect conditions for some bizarre and unsightly garden problems. If you’ve seen alien looking, orange tentacles blobs sitting in your junipers or cedars, you know what I’m talking about.\n\nConcerned gardeners are bringing scores of samples and stories of Juniper-Hawthorne rust into the greenhouse daily. It’s a fungal disease that, while not fatal to infected plants, does make certain plants look like they’ve been “slimed.”\n\nJuniper-Hawthorne rust is closely related to Cedar-Apple rust; the only thing that really differentiates them is the plants they infect. They need two specific hosts to complete their two year life cycle.\n\nIf your junipers are infected (or your cedars with Cedar-Apple), you would have noticed gelatinous orange blobs hanging off the branches in June. They look like orange octopuses, with slimy tentacles (called teliohorns) dangling from the main gooey mass.\n\nEach teliohorn has thousands of spores inside of it just waiting to catch a ride on the breeze and ride through the garden. When they mature in mid summer, the dispersing spores can only latch on to a specific secondary host.\n\nIn the case of Juniper-Hawthorne rust, the spores travel from their primary host (junipers) to their secondary hosts (hawthorne, mountain ash, and apples). With Cedar-Apple rust, the spores travel from cedars to apples, mountain ash, pears, and saskatoons.\n\nThe secondary hosts don’t acquire the gelatinous teliohorns. They get rust spots on their leaves that are orange with dark red to black centers. In the late summer, a different kind of spore blows from the secondary host back to the primary, where it lurks over winter until it can re-emerge in the spring.\n\nDamage and Prevention\n\nThe good news is that this disease, thought disgusting, won’t cause significant damage to your juniper. The bad news is that if it hits your apple trees hard it can lead to significant defoliation and a reduced fruit yield.\n\nThere is no magic bullet. The disease starts as a gall on juniper or cedar stems in the late summer. From there, the jelly tentacles won’t emerge till the next spring so you have time to cut it out. If you or your neighbours have had the disease, look for a brown-orange gall on your evergreen stems in late summer.\n\nWhether you can catch the growing gall or find the unmistakable orange blob the next spring, it’s important to remove the growth before it spores and damages the secondary hosts. Cut all infected branches 8 inches from the growth. Burn the fungus and disinfect your tools with a light bleach solution.\n\nIf it’s already on your apples, Hawthorne, and ash trees, remove as many infected leaves as feasible. The fewer leaves there are, the fewer spores will find their way back to the primary host to continue the life cycle. As a precaution, if you find the orange blobs you could sprinkle some sulphur dust on the leaves.\n\nThe best defense is to keep the primary and secondary hosts separate. If you’re in the midst of planning your yard, consider leaving some distance between these varieties.\n\nAs this is our third rainy spring, I consider this fungus well established. While you’ll see more of it on rainy years and less on dry years, it’s here to stay so the best offense you have is to learn how to identify it early and keep it off your deciduous trees.\n\nTitle: Tree ID: Yew tree | Washington State Parks\n\nby beowulf brower and the state parks arbor crew how do you identify a yew? compared to most of our trees, the yew is tiny. most grow to a height of only about 60 feet and seldom exceed 20 inches in diameter. the bark, especially on the older trees, is unlike anything found in the region. it forms as irregular scales of reds, purples and browns. they don ’ t have a set growth pattern either : they may look like an overgrown shrub, a perfect miniature of a bigger conifer or something in between. yew needles are a waxy dark green with a flat appearance. they rise from the trunk or the middle of the branches. this dark color and seemingly random growth are adaptations so the yew can survive in shade where there ’ s less competition from its bigger, light - loving neighbors. the needles are not too distinct otherwise, but the cones are another story! the yew cone looks like a berry. but that red “ berry ” is actually a modified wooden scale known as an aril. this foil allows the yew to tempt birds to aid the yew ’ s reproduction. birds eat the yummy - looking arils, which pass right through, leaving the seed undamaged and deposited far from its parent. the undamaged seed is good for the tree and the bird, as the seeds are toxic. in other words, please don't eat them! the yew is thought to be poisonous because of livestock poisoning reports in the western hemisphere, but many wild animals ( like moose in idaho and elk and deer in oregon and washington ) browse on yews, making it an important food source in the forest. due to its low height, it remains accessible to wildlife throughout its centuries - long life span. the yew has a storied and fascinating history of medicinal use. the last century saw the discovery of paclitaxel, a compound extracted from the bark of the pacific yew, which became the basis for the widely used cancer drug taxol. fortunately, the population of yews wasn ’ t decimated to make taxol. the northwest forest plan, which codified protections for old - growth forests where yews commonly grow, was passed in 1994, and a synthetic version of taxol became available in the early 2000s. the gift from this tree has helped to treat over a million people to date. a slow and steady growth cool fact : a douglas fir that sprouts today will, in 50 years, be larger than a yew 10 times that age. for the yew, longevity and tenacity are not represented by size, but by structure. the largest known pacific yew was found to have grown less than an inch in diameter over 30 years. this tree is nearly five feet in diameter, so you do the math! ok, we ’ re here to help : our back - of - the - napkin math puts this tree at well over 1, 000 years old. it ’ s hard to tell a yew ’ s age by counting rings. the wood is resistant to decay, but centuries of attacks by pathogens can leave the oldest trees hollow. given the strength of the wood, this is usually of little consequence to the yew. if they age slowly, they reproduce just as slow. remember the bright red arils and birds that eat them? after the bird passes the seed, that seed can take months to germinate and",

Despite having “slug” and “fly” in their name, they are neither. Similarly, even though they look like caterpillars, they are not related and won't be vulnerable to some of the same low-impact pesticides. Picking them off and disposing of them is the most practical pesticide-free option, though you probably don't need to worry about any plants whose leaves are completely brown because the larvae have already moved on or died from running out of food. Clipping off these brown leaves or cutting the entire shrub back should help it look better while it rebounds. If the roots are healthy, it should leaf back out again in a few weeks or less with no special care other than the usual monitoring for soil moisture during hot dry spells.
Blasting the rose leaves top and bottom with a strong jet of water from a garden hose should also dislodge most of the larvae. If you can't find enough of them and need to resort to a pesticide, one good option is the active ingredient spinosad. Several products contain this ingredient, but whichever you choose, make sure it's labeled for use on roses (or at least shrubs). This is only practical if the plant still has some green foliage, as it will not absorb well (if at all) into dead leaves. The other pesticide alternatives (choosing one, not combining them) are horticultural oil or insecticidal soap. Here too, you have many product choices, but do not substitute either with a home remedy. Hort. oils and soaps are trickier to use in that they must contact the pest directly to be effective, so if the sawfly larvae are either gone or missed, the spray will not affect them. Contact sprays like these also have to coat the leaf undersides in order to affect larvae hiding there, and this can be difficult to achieve with most garden sprayers.
The plants should recover. How many generations of sawfly will recur on the roses depends on which species of sawfly is present. They look alike, so you may just need to wait and see if their damage reappears after treatment or the plant regrows lost foliage to know if re-treatment is needed. Fortunately, these insects do not bother non-rose shrubs.

Title: Rose: Identify and Manage Problems | University of Maryland Extension
Tips for diagnosing plant problems
The majority of plant problems are not caused by a disease or an insect, especially if the plant has been in your landscape for less than two years.
The presence of an insect or disease may not be the cause of the problem. Sometimes pests will take advantage of damaged or declining plants or the damage may have occurred way before you noticed it.
It is okay to tolerate some plant damage. For example, many fungal leaf spots cause cosmetic damage. Unsightly leaves can be simply pruned off the plant.
Poor growing conditions, incorrect care, weather extremes, and soggy soil are the major cause of plant decline.
Become familiar with normal plant characteristics throughout the year.
There are numerous parasitoids and predators that keep insect pests under control.
Use a pesticide only as a last resort and apply with care. First, identify the pest or disease and select low-toxicity products.

Title: Plant Identification Guides
Plant identification guides can aid biologists with proper identification of plant species in the field, such as when determining whether an area meets the criteria for classification as a wetland, or in assessing the floristic quality of a site for natural areas protection.
The Commission has also prepared lists of plants suitable for landscaping in Southeastern Wisconsin. Landscaping guides and invasive species eradication information can be found on the Zoning & Ordinances page.

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses : - leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib. - leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature. - growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses. - vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species. - inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns. - seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets. - stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature. - root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons. - habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates. to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities. identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a boat - shaped tip, and a prominent midrib on the upper side. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads through rhizomes, creating a dense, interconnected turf. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : pyramid - shaped panicle with branches that spread outward, containing small spikelets on delicate stalks. - color : deep green to bluish - green. bermudagrass ( cynodon dactylon ) - leaf blade : narrow, flat, and slightly rough on the upper side, with a pointed tip. - growth habit : spreads vigorously through both stolons and rhizomes. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a finger - like arrangement of spikes radiating from a central point, with each spike containing several spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. zoysiagrass ( zoysia spp. ) - leaf blade : narrow, stiff, and sharp, with a fine texture and a tapering tip. the upper side of the leaf blade is often hairy near the base. - growth habit : spreads through both stolons and rhizomes, creating a dense turf. - vernation : rolled. - inflorescence : a slender, branched panicle containing small spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. st. augustine grass ( stenotaphrum secundatum ) - leaf blade : broad, flat, and relatively coarse, with a rounded or tapering tip. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads primarily through stolons, forming a dense, carpet - like lawn. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a spike - like raceme containing several spikelets, often with a purplish hue. - color : medium to dark green. fescue grass ( festuca spp. ) - includes fine fescue and tall fescue - leaf blade : fine fescue has very narrow, needle - like leaves, while tall fescue has broader leaves with a prominent midrib. both have a slightly rough texture on the upper side. - growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps. - vernation : rolled ( fine fescue ) or folded ( tall fescue ). - inflorescence : fine fescue has a panicle - like inflorescence, while tall fescue has a more spike - like inflorescence. both contain small spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a shiny appearance on the upper side and a tapering tip. the leaf edges have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a spike - like inflorescence containing spikelets that are arranged alternately on a central stem. - color : bright green to dark green. by observing these identifying characteristics, you can distinguish between the most common lawn grasses and better understand their growth habits and appearance. keep in mind that variations can occur within each species, and hybrid cultivars may exhibit unique features.

Title: Buck Moth Caterpillar Defoliates Oak Trees | Davey Tree
Buck Moth Caterpillar Description:
The buck moth caterpillar is a serious pest that defoliates oaks, particularly in the southeastern United States. The moths have dark gray wings with an irregular, median white band and a crescent-shaped, white mark bordered in black on each wing.
Caterpillars eat the leaves of oak trees, (primarily live oaks, but also water oaks). They are found from Maine to Georgia and west to Texas. The caterpillars destroy a tree’s natural beauty and vigor, making it more susceptible to diseases and insect attacks.
Buck Moth Caterpillar Life Cycle & Symptoms:
Moths emerge from the soil in late fall, post-leaf drop. Each female deposits 70-200 whitish-tan eggs in a cluster encircling the oak twigs. Larvae hatch over a prolonged period starting in early spring and caterpillars can appear before the leaves emerge. By mid-spring, the larvae have undergone 5 growth stages, growing from 1/8” larvae to 2 ½” caterpillars. Caterpillar spines often cause dermal irritation. Young buck moth caterpillars will organize themselves into communities and will even follow each other in a single file. They are often seen migrating across lawns or climbing the sides of buildings in search of places to pupate in the fall. Moths normally appear at the start of deer hunting season, thus the name, buck moth.
Buck Moth Caterpillar Control & Management:
There are several control options, including such biorationals as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) and horticultural oil. Affected trees should also be fertilized with Arbor Green PRO® to improve their recovery and overall vigor.

of spongy moth fluctuate, severe or repeated defoliation of garden and forest trees can kill large numbers of trees. its preferred species is oak (quercus), but spongy moth caterpillars feed on hundreds of tree species, including : - boxelder (acer negundo) - american mountain ash (sorbus) - lombardy poplar (populus) - sweetgum (liquidambar) spongy moth quarantine in virginia loudon and fairfax counties have been under spongy moth quarantine for some time, as have all but a few virginia counties. for details, see the virginia spongy moth quarantine map published by the state’s department of agriculture. in addition to vehicles, household items, and machinery left outside, firewood is one of the most common ways that insect eggs and larvae are spread. to prevent the spread of destructive insects to forests and wildlands, virginia state parks forbid campers and visitors from bringing firewood into the parks. information about firewood quarantines is here. controlling spongy moth controlling spongy moth is difficult, but homeowners can take the following steps : - scrape off egg masses from surfaces and submerge in soapy water for a few days to kill the eggs. - spray egg masses with a horticultural oil spray designed for spongy moths. - wrap tree trunks with sticky bands to catch larvae as they crawl down tree trunks. for homeowners, virginia tech’s agricultural extension website has information about spongy moth management here. the most effective control of spongy moth larvae in forests is entomophaga maimaiga, a fungus that kills spongy moth larvae. wet spring weather encourages the growth of the fungus, which controls larvae by overwhelming it with fungal spores. when the larvae die, the spores are released and are carried on the wind to other larvae. this fungus, which overwinters in soil, targets only spongy moth larvae. give us a call at 703-402-9366 if you'd like help with your trees or landscape, have any questions, or would like to schedule an appointment with one of our certified arborists, please give us a call. we'd love to hear from you!

if you're growing apple trees in your home garden, dealing with apple tree pests might already be on your radar. these pests can be a real challenge, especially for those new to apple tree care. as trusted experts, we know that these unwelcome visitors are common, and if not properly managed, they can impact your tree's health and fruit production. so, if you're looking for reliable ways to protect your apple trees, you've come to the right place. in this article, we'll dive deeper into identifying apple tree pests, understanding the damage they cause, and exploring natural methods to protect your trees. if you're ready to take control of your apple tree's health and enjoy a thriving harvest, continue reading to learn more. what this article covers : - common apple tree pests - how to keep apple tree pests at bay - organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees? common apple tree pests pests can affect your apple tree in a variety of ways, from damaging leaves to ruining fruit. here are some of the most frequent culprits : the apple maggot fly is one of the most common and damaging pests that apple growers face, often even more so than the codling moth. the adult fly lays its eggs beneath the skin of the apple, and when the larvae hatch, they tunnel through the fruit, creating winding brown trails. this damage can cause the fruit to become deformed, rot, and drop prematurely. our findings show that the apple maggot fly can destroy a large portion of your harvest if not properly managed. netting apple trees is one of the most effective organic pest control methods to prevent apple maggot flies from laying eggs on your fruit. early detection and intervention are key to minimizing damage from these pests. codling moths are among the most damaging apple tree pests that home growers encounter. the adult moths lay eggs on apples, and once the larvae hatch, they burrow into the fruit. this creates unsightly brown trails inside the apples, often leading to rotting and early fruit drop. our findings show that the codling moth larvae can destroy large portions of your crop if left untreated. if you've ever cut into an apple and found a worm inside, it's almost certainly due to a codling moth infestation. preventing these pests early in the season with proper monitoring and treatment is essential for maintaining healthy fruit. spider mites are tiny pests that can cause significant damage to your apple tree if not properly managed. if you spot brown spots on apple tree leaves or a dusty appearance on the foliage, it's often a sign of spider mite activity. these pests feed by sucking the sap from the leaves, weakening your tree over time and reducing its ability to produce healthy fruit. spider mites spread quickly, especially in hot and dry conditions, which can lead to a more widespread infestation if left untreated. regular monitoring and early intervention are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. they tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. this feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. one of the most"

User > Why is my staghorn sumac not doing well? I had six 'Tiger Eyes' staghorn sumac planted along the roadside of my property. The location is under much taller trees, yellow poplar and some variety of buckeye, so I'd call it partial sun or partial shade. On a slight slope, not particularly wet or dry. The plants went in around March of this year, and we've been consistently ensuring they get watered twice a week. All of them, when planted, had an appropriate amount of fresh green growth and initially seemed happy. Since then all six have lost their leaves. I tried caging them about a month ago. Since then, one of them has produced a good cluster of leaves right at its base but the others remain completely barren! All of the inkberry holly and sweetspire planted at the same time are thriving (and without caging). I want to have the staghorn sumac replaced, but I'm wondering if there's some systemic reason they're doing so poorly. Wish I had more clues as to what is wrong, any ideas?

Title: Staghorn sumac - pruning, care, Rhus typhina toxicity

staghorn sumac, also called vinegar sumac, is a short tree that grows in a roundish shape. key staghorn tree facts : family : anacardiaceae height : 16 feet ( 5 m ) foliage : deciduous – flowering : june to august it ’ s found very appealing for its fuzzy red fruit clusters, but sometimes becomes problematic because it spreads very fast. it doesn ’ t make any difference whether your staghorn tree is planted in spring or fall. propagation through root cuttings in fall, but you can also just wait for it to send shoots up from the running roots and dig those out. staghorn sumac can turn out to be rather invasive, both because its seeds sprout easily and because underground roots send up shoots. in pruning, your goal is to keep the tree as a single, balanced tree. → before pruning your staghorn sumac, slip on a pair of gloves, because the sap is a bit sticky ( and, for some people, highly irritating ). staghorn sumac has rather brittle wood that can ’ t cope very well with windstorms. never climb into the tree to prune it, and don ’ t even think of hanging a swingset from it. staghorn sumac will bounce back from even the hardest pruning. if you cut it down to a stump, new shoots will reappear in the following spring from the vigorous root system. it ’ s as strong a grower as bay in this respect. hatracking, or cutting back completely just to shorten the tree, is strongly discouraged. indeed, new branches would come out that are only weakly connected to the tree. on a staghorn tree, these branches would very easily break off if it gets windy. dangerous if people walk nearby. not a problem if you contain growth to less than 6 - 8 feet ( 2 - 2. 5 meters ). that being said, it ’ s best to simply shorten the longest branches by cutting them back to a junction. for example, if a branch splits into two smaller branches, cut the longer of the two back to the junction. if the tree still feels too large, go for a second round. best do this in fall, after leaves have fallen. a very beautiful shrub with a spectacular summer blooming, sumac is also remarkable in fall, when its foliage rolls over to flamboyant hues before falling off. it is definitely among the most beautiful ornamental shrubs from september to december. this easy to care for shrub will produce the nicest impact as a standalone, because as years go by it tends to grow wide instead of tall. staghorn sumac fruits can be used to prepare lemonade, all that has to be done is to prepare a decoction from the fruits. it ’ s a relative of both cashew and pistachio nut trees. the tangy, acidic taste gave the tree its other common name : the vinegar tree. its fruits contain high doses of vitamin c and tannin compounds. while very common, staghorn sumac isn ’ t dangerous to most people. other species that share common ancestors, like poison sumac ( toxicodendron vernix, formerly rhus vernix ) and the chinese lacquer tree ( toxicodendron vernicifluum, formerly rhus vernicifera ) are very poisonous for most humans and pets.

User > Attached is a photo of the minute bug, known as the Mandevilla bug, on the stems of my mandevilla plant. I have repeatedly washed the leaves and sprayed both sides of the leaves and soil with a pyrethrin insect spray. It seems to take care of the problem for about a week and then little white 'flakes' appear on the leaves and soon after, I see little green 'bumps' on the stems. Using a magnifier, I was able to get a picture of the bugs. I've tried to identify them but haven't found anything that looks like them. Please help me solve this vexing issue.

There's nothing stopping your tough and beautiful mandevillas as they scramble up the brightest trellis in the garden -- that's why these plants are such favorites with gardeners! Easy and carefree, these vines rarely fail; when they do, it is often because of the few insect pests of mandevilla. Read on to better understand mandevilla bug infestations and cures.
Mandevilla Pest Problems
Mandevilla vines are tough plants, but even they are subject to a few pest insects that can cause real problems. Bugs on mandevilla vine are easy to treat if they're caught early, but you'll have to keep a close eye out for them since these insects often remain well-hidden.
Mealybugs leave small piles of waxy debris on the branch crotches of mandevilla vines, feeding nearby or on the undersides of leaves. These pests produce copious amounts of honeydew as the pests feed on plant juices, causing leaves below feeding sites to appear sticky or shiny. Ants may cluster near these sites, collecting the honeydew and defending the mealybugs from harm. Spray your plant with insecticidal soap and recheck it often for signs of mealybugs. If leaves continue to yellow and drop, you may need to spray your plant weekly to destroy new mealybugs as they emerge from their waxy egg sacs.
Scale insects are the most difficult of the mandevilla pests; they are experts at camouflage, often appearing as irregular growths or waxy deposits on stems and leaves. Some scale produce honeydew, like mealybugs, but insecticidal soaps will rarely take them out due to their hard coverings. Neem oil is the spray of choice for scale, and weekly spray treatments are the norm. If you notice the scale bugs are changing colors or your plant begins to recover, lift some of the scales' hard covers to check for signs of life.
Spider mites are usually difficult to see with the naked eye, but their damage is unmistakable -- individual leaves are suddenly covered in tiny, yellow dots that may grow together before the leaf dries and falls off the plant. Spider mites also weave fine strands of silk where they're feeding, which can aid in your decision to treat them. Spider mites are attracted to dusty conditions, so if your plant isn't too punky, start by spraying down any dry spots and cleaning the dust off your plant's leaves, especially indoors. If spider mites persist, insecticidal soap or neem oil are recommended.
Whiteflies are tiny, moth-like insects that congregate in large groups on the undersides of leaves. They cause similar damage to mealybugs, stressing leaves until they drop, but are extremely visible and easy to identify. You may notice tiny white insects flying up when you bump your plant or walk too close; check the plant carefully for feeding sites when it starts to look unwell. Whiteflies drown easily, so they can usually be cured with regular sprays from a garden hose.

User: Insect Bite? Over the weekend, I was soaking in the bathtub and suddenly I felt a sharp sting and a burning sensation. It was pretty painful and the stinging/burning sensation lasted for quite awhile. When I drained the tub, I found this insect (see attached pictures). I do not recognize this particular insect. Are you able to tell from the pictures what it is? As far as the bite itself, it immediately turned into a welt with a dot in the middle. I applied ice to the area, then calamine lotion. Later, I made a bread and milk poultice and covered it with a bandaid and gauze. The next morning, the swelling from the welt was gone and I did not see a stinger. I do, however, have a large red mark next to the bite which has a welt underneath. Not sure, but possibly an ice burn from the ice pack I used? Thank you for any information you can share with me.

I found what I think is a moth cocoon of either a diamondback moth or another cabbage-eating moth on some organic broccoli from the store. I attached a photo. Do I need to destroy a moth cocoon on organic broccoli from the store, or are they so ubiquitous that it doesn't matter if I compost it?

User > Regarding Techny Arborvitae, the last two years we have planted 2 techny arborvitae (one on the south side and one on the east side) around our home to fill in some gaps between other larger arborvitae trees. The trees we planted in 2020 did not make it and we exchanged them for new ones which we had planted professionally in the spring of 2021. Unfortunately, the trees are not in good shape and appear as though they may need to be replaced again. Is there any action that can be taken this spring/summer to revive them? If not, and we need to plant new trees, is there concern about the new trees being so little compared to the established trees? I am concerned they will never get enough sunlight because they are overshadowed by the larger ones and will never thrive. Is this a legitimate concern? Or does it appear possible they actually did not get enough water over the summer of 2021 and new trees would just need a better care routine? Happy to send more pictures or info if needed.

EVIDENCE:
Title: Techny Arborvitae — Windbreak Trees
techny arborvitae - thuja occidentalis for prices and sizes click here. the techny arborvitae is a clone of its parent plant the white cedar or american arborvitae. this special cultivar was found growing in mission gardens in techny, illinois and due to its strong characteristics has been cloned ever since and is sometimes called the mission arborvitae. it is a medium growing ( 1 - 2ft per year ) evergreen that has a dark green soft foliage. in september of each year it “ sheds “ all the growth that grew out the previous year and it drops to the ground creating a very nice mulch around the tree. its parent plant is a native to the northern us where it grows extensively and some fine, large specimens can be found on mackinac island on lake heron in michigan they can grow 30 + ft tall and 16 + ft wide and the spreading root system is very wind firm but the wood is not quite so strong and can be damaged by high winds, snow and ice. this tree can live 100 years or longer, its parent plant can live over 500 years in the north. age limiting factor is usually how close they are planted together as close planting and dry weather will shorten life. this tree has multiple leaders, so some damage to the top of the tree in ice and snow just lets one of the other “ leaders ” take over so the effect is minor in a windbreak. the foliage extends down to the ground, excellent for blocking winds. deer will eat this foliage in the winter and severe damage and death can result with smaller plants, with larger plants all the foliage can be eaten off within 6 ft of the ground. deer reduction or fencing may have to be used in some areas. the techny arborvitae grows well in a hardiness zone from 3 - 7 and likes over 25 \\\" of rain per year in areas with adequate soil to hold moisture during the dry months. does not do well in sandy soil as has a shallow root system and in droughty conditions, losses can result. will grow well in high ph soils such as along gravel roads, in clay soils and soils with extra moisture. should not be planted in states where hot dry summers usually occur ( nebraska, montana, wyoming, kansas ect. ) unless extra moisture can be provided. disease problem are few with no fungal disease problems and few insect problems such as bag worms or spider mites in a dry hot summer. the techny arborvitae has shown to be a better plant for use in windbreaks than any other arborvitaes and is more drought resistant. we have tested then against the american, nigra, dark green, emerald green and green giant arborvitaes, and the techny always comes out on top. as with any arborvitae if you have less than 1 inch of rain in a 30 day period from may through september with hot conditions, you should consider watering your trees once a month, no matter how big they are. a soaker hose, water tank, or maybe letting the water dribble out of a hose can do the job and save your trees. a 2 ft potted tree can be over 8 ft tall in 5 years in good soil, adequate moisture, and total weed and grass control. many places on the internet say the techny grows slow and does not get very big ( 10ft ) - - this is untrue. spacing - - is very important for this species, due to its shallow root system and most times are planted way to close together. when planted too close and a major drought hits, the shallow root system cannot get enough moisture for this moisture loving plant and the weakest ones die or the bottom of the plants die back causing a decrease in windbreak efficiency. single row - - 10 - 12 ft apart, double row - - 16 ft between rows and 14 ft apart between plants in row, multiple rows - - 20 ft between rows and 14 ft between plants. we highly recommend the techny arborvitae with certain restrictions : proper spacing and soil conditions should be followed. they are wind resistant and we set them 12 feet apart on the outside of our 3 or more rows of trees, and at least 18 feet from any larger evergreens. due to the fact that techny arborvitae drop 1 / 2 of their foliage every year, the first 2 - 3 years after planting the foliage will look very \\\" thin \\\" as the root system gets established. this is considered normal for all arborvitae species so be patient, they are well worth it. multiple leaders coming out all in one place at the bottom is an issue on this plant, as the tree grows this creates a weak spot and with high winds or heavy snow this will break apart in this area. your tree will simply break off at the weak point, ( see below ) and the tree will be severely damaged or killed and most do not survive long, if the other part is standing it soon breaks apart too. it is too late to prune it at the above potted stage as you will have huge cuts to heal, and little foliage if trying to get to one leader. bagworm can be a problem with arborvitae, and other evergreens. here is a bagworm house hanging on a branch. the fat black worm live in the bag during the day and then in the evening they come out and chew off the foliage. if you have arborvitae or any evergreens you should walk through your trees every year in mid june and july and check to see if you have any of these bags hanging on your trees. if they can be caught early they are easily eliminated by hand picking them off or spraying. to learn more about bagworms just do a search on the internet as there is much information. update : in the winter of 2009 and 2019 we got down to - 38 degrees here on the farm and most of iowa received similar temperatures. this extreme cold killed most of the bagworms in the state of iowa, we have a few reports of them still down near the missouri border and parts south and it looks like there back to there natural levels. keep a careful eye on your trees, and you should have no problems with bagworms. to the right is a row of arborvitae that has been hit by an infestation of bagworms, this happened in just a couple of weeks. they have eaten all the foliage off the trees and these trees are not going to survive. if they were caught early when they first appeared they could have been easily controlled and the trees would have survived with little damage. it usually takes several years for the population to get this large to do this kind of damage. early detection is the key to controlling bagworms, walk threw your arborvitae and all evergreens during the summer, june and july, looking for the bags as shown above. take action by hand picking off small infestations or using an insecticide for larger numbers, and one insecticide i know works is called onyx. if you are interested in this or any of our other trees then head over to our ordering page.

Title: Diamondback Moth Caterpillars Active In South Dakota
Originally Submitted: June 8, 2021
While examining my garden this week, I observed diamondback moth caterpillars on my cabbage. Diamondback moth caterpillars primarily feed on cole crops (e.g., broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, etc.).
In South Dakota, there can be three-to-five generations of diamondback moths each year. Therefore, it’s very likely that additional caterpillars will be observed before the end of the season.
Scouting and Identification
Diamondback moth caterpillars feed on leaves, leaving behind irregular-shaped holes. At first glance, it may seem like defoliation is happening without any caterpillars present, because they feed on the underside of the leaf. If the caterpillars are disturbed, they will violently wriggle and often drop from the plant using a strand of silk. First-instar larvae are leaf miners, but most of this injury will go unnoticed. Other early-life stages will leave behind transparent spots on the leaf. This type of defoliation is referred to as windowpane injury.
Diamondback moths are small with brown-gray coloration and a one-inch wingspan. When at rest, the moths have a broad cream or light-brown band from the head to the end of the front wings. There are often constrictions along the band that will form one or more light-colored diamonds (Figure 1). While at rest, these moths will appear very slender, as they have their wings folded close to their bodies with the ends of the wings curving upwards.
The caterpillars are light-green with a light-green or light-brown head. At maturity, the caterpillars are 3/8 of an inch long, much smaller than the cabbage whites. The caterpillars have four pairs of prolegs (legs in the middle of their bodies). They also have one pair of prolegs at the end of their body that form a “V” shape, as they are almost always extended backwards. When disturbed, the caterpillars will make a loop shape with their bodies. The caterpillar’s body is narrower at the head and wider near the end of the body.
When the diamondback moth caterpillars reach their last instar, or growth stage, they will spin a silken web and often attach themselves to the bottom of a leaf (Figure 3). They will then form a silken pupa and pupate on the undersides of the leaves. If you observe any pupae on a plant, remove and destroy them.
For gardens, the easiest way to manage diamondback moths is to remove caterpillars or pupae by hand and destroy them. If large populations are present, using an insecticidal powder on the plants may reduce feeding. To effectively reach the populations, the bottoms of the leaves need to be treated. Since these caterpillars are feeding on the plant parts gardeners harvest, make sure to pay attention to pre-harvest intervals on the label. The pre-harvest interval is the amount of time you must let pass between applying the pesticide and harvesting the crop.

Title: Black knot | UMN Extension

black knot is a common fungal disease of prunus trees including ornamental, edible, and native plum and cherry trees. hard swollen black galls ( tumor like growths ) form on branches and occasionally on trunks. many prunus trees tolerate black knot. tolerant trees have many galls throughout the tree with few negative effects on the health of the tree. some prunus trees are more severely affected by black knot. in these trees, leaves and shoots wilt and die on branches with galls. management will vary depending on how severely the tree is affected by black knot. how to identify black knot black knot galls are most noticeable during fall and winter after all the leaves have fallen. knobby, swollen black growths called galls grow along the length of stems and branches. in early summer, young galls or new areas of growth on the edges of older galls are covered with velvety, olive - green spores. these galls turn black and hard by the end of the summer. infected branches may bend to one - sided due to growth of the gall. there can be anywhere from a few galls to hundreds of galls within the tree canopy. leaves remain healthy and green even on branches with galls in black knot tolerant trees. leaves wilt, turn brown and die on branches with galls in trees that are highly susceptible to black knot. brown, wilted leaves at the end of branches are often scattered throughout the tree on highly susceptible trees. large areas of rough black swollen bark form on the main tree trunk. black knot galls on trunks are often cracked and may ooze sticky liquid. wood decay fungi may enter the trunk through cracks caused by black knot galls and cause wood rot. most susceptible ( likely to be damaged by black knot ) american plum ( p. americana ) canadian plum, including ‘ princess kay ’ ( p. nigra ) chokecherry, including : ‘ shubert ’ and ‘ canada red ’ ( p. virginiana ) european bird cherry ( p. padus ) european plum, including : ‘ stanley ’ ( p. domestica ) japanese plum ( p. salicina ) purple leafed plum ( p. cerasifera ) less susceptible ( may be infected but often tolerates black knot ) nanking cherry ( p. tomentosa ) pin cherry ( p. pensylvanica ) sargent cherry ( p. sargentii ) sand cherry ( p. pumila ) sour cherry ( p. cerasus ) western sand cherry ( p. purmila var. besseyi ), including : purple leaf sand cherry prunus x cistena amur chokecherry ( p. maacki ) apricot ( p. armeniaca ) flowering almond ( p. triloba ) how does black knot survive and spread? - black knot is caused by the fungus apiosporina morbosa. the black knot fungus overwinters in the galls on branches and trunks. spores are released during wet periods in the spring. the wind carries these spores to trees where they infect young green shoots or wounded branches. the fungus grows within the branch for several months with no outward symptoms of disease. as the fungus grows, it releases chemicals that make the tree grow extra plant cells that are unusually large. this unusual growth results in the swollen, woody galls. galls are made up of both plant and fungal tissue. one year after infection, galls can be seen as a swollen area of the branch with a velvety olive green covering of fungal growth. two years after infection, the gall has turned black and hard. these galls release spores in spring when wet. sometimes, the branch and the gall die after spores are released in early spring. if the branch lives, the knot keeps getting bigger and produces new spores every spring. the gall can completely encircle and girdle a branch. when this happens, the leaves beyond the gall wilt and die. although the black knot fungus will not cause the trunk to rot, the cracks from the infection can let in other wood rotting fungi. how to manage black knot in areas where there are many wild prunus sp. infected with black knot, avoid planting landscape and edible prunus sp. if only a few infected wild prunus sp. are present, prune out existing galls or completely remove infected plants to reduce the amount of fungal spores present before planting landscape and edible prunus sp. choose trees that have some tolerance to black knot. ( see tree list above under “ trees affected by black knot in minnesota ”. ) inspect all trees and shrubs for black knot before purchasing them from the garden center. do not purchase any trees with black knot galls. black knot galls can be removed from infected trees through pruning. this will make ornamental plants look better and reduce the amount of fungal spores produced within the tree canopy each spring. pruning out galls is not necessary in trees where black knot galls do not result in wilt and death of leaves and young branches. pruning cuts should be made in late winter ( february or march ) when temperatures are below freezing. this will prevent black knot spores from infecting the pruning wound. make the pruning cut at least 4 inches below the black knot gall. infected branches should be removed from the area and burned, buried, or disposed of. infected branches left below the tree will continue to release spores that can start new infections in the tree. to maintain a black knot free tree, it will be necessary to inspect the tree and prune out any new galls each winter. cracked and oozing galls on trunks or large branches should be inspected by a certified arborist to determine if the tree is stable. black knot will not rot wood but wood decay fungi can enter through cracks caused by black knot. these fungi cause wood rot that weakens the tree. fungicides can be used to protect young trees or trees that will be severely affected by black knot. prune out any existing galls in late winter before applying fungicides in spring. fungicide sprays must be applied in early spring to protect young green shoots. begin fungicide treatment when flower buds are just beginning to open. repeat sprays according to label instructions until shoots mature or weather is consistently warm and dry. sprays work the best when applied before a rain event when temperatures are warmer than 60°f. before applying fungicide read the label carefully. the plant to be treated must be listed on the label or the fungicide cannot be used on that plant. not all fungicides registered for use on ornamental prunus varieties can be used on edible prunus varieties. for large trees, high - pressure spraying equipment is needed in order to get complete coverage. hire a professional arborist who can safely operate all necessary equipment. fungicides with one of the following active ingredients are effective in protecting trees from black knot : caution : mention of a pesticide or use of a pesticide label is for educational purposes only. always follow the pesticide label directions attached to the pesticide container you are using. be sure that the plant you wish to treat is listed on the label of the pesticide you intend to use. and observe the number of days between pesticide application and when you can harvest your crop. remember, the label is the law.

User > My bottlebrush tree died in a freeze but came back to life! I have a rather large bottlebrush tree that died in a freeze and all the limbs dried out. I’ve cut the majority of the limbs and I noticed the bark was coming off as well. There is some new growth at the very bottom of the trunk, which is very exciting because we really loved that tree. My question is how far do I cut the tree back so that it can come back healthy? Do I cut it all the way down to a stump? Should I be concerned about the bark?

Title: Techny Arborvitae — Windbreak Trees
##ble out of a hose can do the job and save your trees. a 2 ft potted tree can be over 8 ft tall in 5 years in good soil, adequate moisture, and total weed and grass control. many places on the internet say the techny grows slow and does not get very big ( 10ft ) - - this is untrue. spacing - - is very important for this species, due to its shallow root system and most times are planted way to close together. when planted too close and a major drought hits, the shallow root system cannot get enough moisture for this moisture loving plant and the weakest ones die or the bottom of the plants die back causing a decrease in windbreak efficiency. single row - - 10 - 12 ft apart, double row - - 16 ft between rows and 14 ft apart between plants in row, multiple rows - - 20 ft between rows and 14 ft between plants. we highly recommend the techny arborvitae with certain restrictions : proper spacing and soil conditions should be followed. they are wind resistant and we set them 12 feet apart on the outside of our 3 or more rows of trees, and at least 18 feet from any larger evergreens. due to the fact that techny arborvitae drop 1 / 2 of their foliage every year, the first 2 - 3 years after planting the foliage will look very \\\" thin \\\" as the root system gets established. this is considered normal for all arborvitae species so be patient, they are well worth it. multiple leaders coming out all in one place at the bottom is an issue on this plant, as the tree grows this creates a weak spot and with high winds or heavy snow this will break apart in this area. your tree will simply break off at the weak point, ( see below ) and the tree will be severely damaged or killed and most do not survive long, if the other part is standing it soon breaks apart too. it is too late to prune it at the above potted stage as you will have huge cuts to heal, and little foliage if trying to get to one leader. bagworm can be a problem with arborvitae, and other evergreens. here is a bagworm house hanging on a branch. the fat black worm live in the bag during the day and then in the evening they come out and chew off the foliage. if you have arborvitae or any evergreens you should walk through your trees every year in mid june and july and check to see if you have any of these bags hanging on your trees. if they can be caught early they are easily eliminated by hand picking them off or spraying. to learn more about bagworms just do a search on the internet as there is much information. update : in the winter of 2009 and 2019 we got down to - 38 degrees here on the farm and most of iowa received similar temperatures. this extreme cold killed most of the bagworms in the state of iowa, we have a few reports of them still down near the missouri border and parts south and it looks like there back to there natural levels. keep a careful eye on your trees, and you should have no problems with bagworms. to the right is a row of arborvitae that has been hit by an infestation of bagworms, this happened in just a couple of weeks. they have eaten all the foliage off the trees and these trees are not going to survive. if they were caught early when"

I tried using the black tar product made for sealing wounds, but it bled right through. Can you suggest another route to take? I'm thinking of wrapping it tightly, but I don't know what to use or if it would work?

It isn't happening to every poplar tree, and it isn't happening to any other kind of tree that I have noticed. Any idea what might be causing this? It can be very far off the ground, so it's not deer or mice. Sometimes there will be holes, but usually not. Would woodpeckers do this?

Title: What is stripping the bark off my tree branches? | Purdue Extension Forestry & Natural Resources
Bark stripping is a common practice among many species of tree squirrels. Squirrels don’t actually eat the bark; they strip away the top layer to get to the sweet, phloem tissue underneath. Bark stripping occurs most frequently in early summer. It can kill trees outright or make them susceptible to insect infestation or fungal pathogens. Squirrels prefer to strip bark from small trees (less than 2.4 inches). Even if trees aren’t killed outright, bark stripping can stunt a tree’s growth or lead to malformation of the wood. (Source: R. W. Thorington, Jr., and K. Ferrell. 2006. Squirrels: The Animal Answer Guide. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. 183 pp.) Also see FNR 203: Why Do Animals Eat the Bark and Wood of Trees and Shrubs?

milkweed bug infestation of butterfly weed now, we did know that liatris tends to get chewed on. it is not unusual to find a new spike felled every few days by vandal rabbits. our hope was for strength in numbers. if we planted a whole bunch of liatris, then a downed spear here and there would not be missed. butterfly weed ( asclepias tuberosa ) is so named not only because butterflies feed on its nectar, but because it is a host plant for the monarch butterfly ( danaus plexippus ) — as are other asclepias species, such as the less beautiful common milkweed ( asclepias syriaca ). monarch moms lay their eggs on these plants, which are then eaten by the resulting caterpillars. while butterfly weed provides nutrition for the monarch caterpillars, it also arms them with a toxin which makes monarch butterflies distasteful to predators. i was hoping this might also offer some protection to the interspersed liatris. only the butterfly weed ( and one lonely liatris ) remained. in time, monarch butterflies did indeed find our patch. they danced happily from plant to plant laying eggs all over. before long, we were spotting numerous caterpillars and were very pleased to play some small part in the survival of this majestic threatened species. milkweed bug infestation then the first of the peculiar bugs appeared — orange and black guys which flew a little, but mostly just hung out on our butterfly weed plants. some of the bugs would pair off, rear end to rear end. as we read online, this is how milkweed bugs ( oncopeltus fasciatus ) mate. soon, there were lots and lots of milkweed bugs all over our butterfly weed. besides mating, milkweed bugs eat milkweed seeds. they have a long mouthpart known as a “ rostrum ” which they use to pierce the plant ’ s seed pods and suck juices right out of the seeds themselves. as with monarch butterflies, the toxic glycosides from the plant make the bug distasteful to predators, and their orange color serves as a warning. birds know not to eat them. as far as i could find out, there wasn ’ t much we could do to control these bugs. poison would also harm the very butterflies and birds we want to encourage. one article i read suggested squishing the bugs individually, but i just don ’ t have that kind of free time. this year, all of those butterfly weed plants have been cleared out. we ’ ll keep the one or two plants we have elsewhere. liatris, however, will get another try. this time around, amy has planted 50 corms — and staked a wire mesh over them to thwart the squirrels until they start sprouting. our solution : pull off the seed pods i say this below in the comments, but i thought i would add it here as well : we have had no further infestations of milkweed bugs since we started plucking the seed pods from the butterfly weed as soon as they appear. this has no adverse effect on the plant. in fact, it seems to promote a weak second flowering. we have no use for the seeds, and this also prevents their silky floss from blowing all over the yard. craig on december 4, 2018 at 9 : 11 am this is just a thaught. all of the butterfly attracting blooms have gone to seed and you now have catterpillers happily munching on your plants would it now be possible to wrap the plants with a light fabric to keep the bugs out? of course timing would have to be watched so the larvea could be let out to pupate ( maybe ) but that should be doable. what do you think? - patrick warren on june 18, 2014 at 1 : 46 pm i planted a moderate patch of butterfly weed and also discovered those pesky milkweed bugs. what i ’ ve changed is instead of one or more moderate or huge sized patches to just a couple of few plants throughout the entire yard. when any milkweed bugs appear i use a pair of leather work gloves and squish them and leave them dead around the plants. this is working well enough as the monarch caterpillars are now getting the upper hand and i ’ m now breeding on average 4 to 6 monarchs every other week or so. i see them flying around my yard every day, feeding, breeding and laying eggs. to keep aphids under control i ’ ve planted dill weed, catnip, oregano, basil, onions, chives and leeks nearby or within the butterfly weed. i also let wasps make nests nearby as they feed on aphids. debi elisabeth on july 6, 2014 at 8 : 21 am so there is nothing you can spray on the black and red aphids without hurting the milkweed for the monarchs to lay eggs?? also, do the aphids eat the eggs as well? patrick warren on july 6, 2014 at 8 : 47 am i don ’ t think aphids affect the monarch eggs, just the plants and they are somewhat less destructive than the milkweed bugs ( beetles ), which seem to attack the flowers and seed pods and end up destroying them. anything you could possibly use for the aphids could have a negative affect on the monarch eggs and caterpillars. when any i have in the yard become badly infected with aphids or beetles i cut them down and move any caterpillars to others that are not infected. since planting the above deterrent plants around the butterfly weed i have not had any aphid infestations. keepitsimple 1 on june 7, 2015 at 6 : 00 pm hi. i know this posting is rather old but i too am trying to find out what to do with these red bugs invading & destroying my butterfly milkweed plants. not only do they suck on the seed pods but they destroy the leaves. a number of plants also look rather sick. it also seems that the monarchs are avoiding the milkweed once these bugs show up & set up shop. i am not too comfortable squashing them. they are just too fast but i noticed that they drop to the ground once you get near them. so i devised a plan of attack. i put some soapy water in a tall chinese takeout soup container. i gently placed the container right under their little gathering and went after them with a one inch paint brush. some dropped right into the soapy water and drowned. others ran under the leafs but again i placed the container right under the leaf & flicked them in. i also went after the little ones hidden at the tops. i just waited a bit to allow the others that got away to regroup on the leaf or stem then i swept them in the container too. i had 100s of bugs on the first day. i patrol the milkweed once a day with my container & brush. i do believe i have them under control & i am seeing more caterpillars & plenty of healthy leaves to chew on. just thought i would spread the word. dg roxanne jones young on november 1, 2015 at 6 : 31 pm so helpful! i just instituted my “ butterfly garden, ” and have these nasty red / black bugs and then found some spore - looking orangy teeny - tiny creatures on the underside of some milkweed leaves. any suggestions? rx keepitsimple 1 on november 3, 2015 at 11 : 08 am hi. great on the butterfly garden. you ’ ll love it. the monarchs are heading down south for the winter. i have a lot of healthy milkweed & other butterfly friendly plants for them. the milkweeds now have the seed pods. so when they have reached full size i clip them, dry them out and plant in pots on the patio until they are tall enough to gently place in the ground. they go into shock quickly so be gentle when transplanting. when you plant in the pot & the ground, i put half of the dead fallen leaves at the bottom for nutrients. i do this many times throughout the year with leaves of other plants i trimmed. that ’ s the secret of my green thumb. i talk to them too and they love it. they are living beings too and they do respond to special human attention. for the plants already in the ground i dig up holes / pockets around the plant & stuff with fallen leaves then cover. the plants love it. we have sandy soil so there isn ’ t much nutrients for them. i also place a string around the base to keep them upright and closer together in their groups. if you don ’ t they will grow all over the place. i don ’ t have much room on the sides of the houses. i also work on some of my retired neighbors flower gardens and planted milkweed all over the place. the butterflies make the rounds around the houses and my mom loves it. i showed her the cats & the butterflies just out of the cocoon drying its wings & she said, “ plant more. ” it ’ s wonderful to see the whole process. keep in mind the wasps also make the patrols too. they will attack and kill and butterfly with wet wings just out of the cocoon. there ’ s not much you can do with that. i have cats also on the seedlings on the patio. they are next to the evergreens so they can have a safe place for the change. one day, i saw what i thought was a monarch dying in the middle of the sidewalk. i gently pick her up and saw that she had just come out of the cocoon and her wings were still wet. i put her under the evergreens so she could dry out her wings and take flight without being harassed by wasps. that ’ s the one i showed my mom. when you see that, it touches your heart and you understand why you do this at a deeper level and you want to do more. i ’ ve had to deal with violence all my life so this is a real treat. this is also great to help manage chronic pain. it gets my mind off all the pain i am in. it ’ s also great to get out in the sun & fresh air. i listen to the birds sing & the squirrel chatter. i was too busy before to notice this. now i appreciate it and all the critters including the lizards that hop around. they have amazing personalities too and eat the bugs i dig up. one day, i dug up a bug & a lizard darted out from under the evergreens to get it. i said, “ it ’ s ok, it ’ s all yours. enjoy & thanks. ” yes, those red bugs are horrible on milkweed. you need to get them under control. try using the plastic container with soapy water so they don ’ t fly out. find a one inch paint brush from the garage and plan your attack. just flick them in. it ’ s rather easy once you get the hang of it. the word is out on my battle plan so they will scoot around to the other side of the stem or leaf. i end up talking to them too, “ ok, i see you. you are out of here. ” call me crazy but its a little game between us. always check the bloom tips, the red bugs have their nurseries in there. the plant looks sick, you have bugs. make sure you also plant more seeds at the base of all your in ground milkweed for new plants. eventually, i clip the old thick ones down to make room for the newer plants. i did eliminate the red bugs from all the plants but i recently saw a few which were swept up right away. it did have a nursery at the top. i use the same attack on the yellow aphids too. they are a bit harder to sweep off but work at it gently with the brush over the container and they too will drop in. they too hang out at the blooms so gently get rid of them too. with one hand i gently bend over the bloom over the container in the same hand then work gently with the brush. this is also how i clean out the red bug nurseries in the blooms. work a little at a time if you have a large garden. eventually, you will get them all. they will drop to the ground if disturbed. with gloves i just scoop them up & throw them into the water too. they will bury themselves so be quick. don ’ t use any pest control. even weed spray will kill monarchs. enjoy your garden and all the other butterflies that visit too. hiram abiff on june 16, 2021 at 2 : 19 pm i found milkweed bugs on my plants the first year i planted them. i just put a cottage cheese container with a mixture of water and dishwashing detergent under the branch and give it a little tap. all the bugs fall off into the soapy water and sink immediately to the bottom. after i few days i don ’ t see them anymore. amyinnh on april 14, 2016 at 4 : 13 pm how ’ d your liatris do? it likes a lot of sun, else it leans. and it looks like they ’ re under a tree in your photo above. mark czerniec on april 14, 2016 at 4 : 52 pm the liatris that survived the squirrels are fine. they ’ re not under a tree, get plenty of sun, and increase each year. jen houchin on september 12, 2016 at 5 : 28 pm can soapy water be sprayed or will this hurry the monarchs also? mark czerniec on september 12, 2016 at 5 : 48 pm i imagine that anything which deters insects in general will also deter monarchs — and the caterpillars munching the leaves probably don ’ t want soap with each bite.

Title: Lemon Tree Leaves Turning Yellow? Causes and Solutions
other important micronutrients available. nutrient deficiencies cause yellow spots and loss of color on foliage. lack of nitrogen when older leaves become chlorotic and loss of color spreads to new foliage, the tree lacks sufficient nitrogen. nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium are the three primary nutrients citrus trees need to produce leaves, flowers, and fruits. fertilize three times annually with a citrus fertilizer or one that has twice the amount of nitrogen as phosphorous and potassium — an npk ratio of 2 - 1 - 1. alternatively, feed your tree nitrogen - rich compost with worm castings or aged manure. lack of iron new leaves that emerge yellow or with yellow veins indicate iron deficiency. the problem spreads to older leaves and can turn them almost white when severe. the cause is lack of iron available in the soil, but it also can be due to overwatering. reduce frequency of watering if needed. iron deficiency can also result from not enough nitrogen, so apply a citrus or nitrogen fertilizer that includes iron. lack of zinc when new leaves yellow and wrinkle, the tree may be struggling from lack of zinc, which helps the plant make chlorophyll. discoloration occurs between green veins, and necrotic spots appear along the center blade of the leaf. new shoots may be stunted, and problems can advance to older foliage. spray leaves with a foliar kelp solution, or add zinc oxide directly to soil. lack of manganese manganese deficiency shows up as yellow spotting on leaves, starting with new growth and spreading to older foliage. leaves often appear dry but, unlike with zinc deficiency, not stunted. this condition often occurs in winter but improves on its own when spring growth begins. if the problem persists, treat soil with a granular manganese fertilizer or dilute it in water and spray foliage. insufficient light when leaves yellow and drop prematurely, your lemon tree may not be getting enough light. it needs close to eight hours of direct sunlight daily. overwinter your potted lemon tree indoors directly in a south - or southwest - facing window to give it the best light. if an immature outdoor lemon tree is not getting enough sunlight, it can be moved to a sunnier area. if you aren't able to relocate your tree, try removing or reducing other foliage shading the tree. cold lemon trees thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. while mature outdoor lemon trees can withstand freezing temperatures for short periods, extended cold can damage leaves, causing them to turn yellow and drop. newly planted and potted trees are more vulnerable to low temperatures. move your potted lemon tree indoors when night time temperatures remain steadily below. cover susceptible outdoor trees with frost cloth when extended cold temperatures are forecast. water thoroughly beforehand to protect roots against frost damage. weeds lemon trees have shallow roots, so nutrient competition from weeds can cause the leaves of lemon trees planted in - ground to yellow. keep a 2 - to 3 - inch layer of mulch around the base of the tree, making sure it doesn't contact the trunk. mulch improves moisture retention and discourages competing weeds. pests aphids, spider mites, and scale are sap - sucking insect pests that feed on leaves that yellow from moisture loss. this seldom results in the death of a plant, but infestations can cause significant damage. check the stems and undersides of leaves for pests. aphids and spider mites can often be knocked off with a strong spray of water. use neem oil or horticultural oil for scale and a mild soap solution for infestations of aphids and spider mites. faq what does an overwatered lemon tree look like? an overwatered lemon trees may have droopy, yellow leaves. it may also emit a foul smell, if rotting. how often should you water a lemon tree? lemon trees should not be watered at regular intervals and should instead be watered as needed, once the top few inches of soil dry out completely. this may happen more or less often depending on the time of year and other factors. does epsom salt help yellow leaves? if the cause of the yellow leaves is a magnesium deficiency, it is possible that epsom salt can help. however, it would be more efficient to treat the soil with a balanced fertilizer. explore more : gardening plants & flowers fruit sources the spruce uses only high - quality sources, including peer - reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles. read our editorial process to learn more about how we fact - check and keep our content accurate, reliable, and trustworthy. how do i feed my citrus tree?. university of arizona cooperative extension.

are very common in the nursery trade. - chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘ pendula ’ : this is the most common cultivar found for sale, especially in the eastern us. i have two in my pennsylvania garden, and they perform beautifully. the branches are even more pendulous on this selection, with the lower branches often touching the ground. it ’ s quite an elegant evergreen tree. this variety grows to 35 feet tall and 12 feet wide. - chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘ green arrow ’ : known commonly as the green arrow weeping alaskan cedar, this variety grows into a very narrow spire. with a height of 20 feet and a width of a mere 2 feet, ‘ green arrow ’ is the best selection for small yards and gardens, or for narrow areas along a driveway or fence. it creates a strong, vertical accent in the landscape. where to plant a weeping alaskan cedar because these beautiful trees grow so large and their graceful branches spread wide, don ’ t try to sandwich them into a small space ( unless of course you ’ re growing the small - space cultivar ‘ green arrow ’ ). give these trees plenty of room to show off. choose a site that receives full sun throughout most of the day. the ideal location should have moist soil, but not waterlogged. consistently moist soil is key, so if you have a low - lying area, this tree is a great choice. however, standing water is a big no - no. also try to choose a location that ’ s protected from harsh winter winds. strong winds can cause needle or branch desiccation and even die - back if winters are extremely cold and windy where you live. though the weeping alaskan cedar is very cold hardy, it does not do well in high - wind areas. problems with chamaecyparis nootkatensis thankfully, there are few problems that plague the weeping alaskan cedar. their pest resistance is yet another reason to love this tree. it has no serious pests in the landscape, though occasionally i find a bagworm or two clinging to the branches. upon occasion, spruce mites can be problematic. however, if you encourage a good population of beneficial insects in your garden by including lots of flowering plants, mite numbers seldom become an issue. the weeping alaskan cedar is also fairly tolerant of road - side pollution, though i suggest keeping it away from sidewalks, roads, and driveways that are routinely treated with road salt in the winter time. or, use a plant - and pet - safe ice melter to protect your plants from damage. caring for a weeping alaskan cedar thankfully, these trees need very little in terms of care and maintenance. - keep the plant mulched with a 2 - to 3 - inch layer of shredded hardwood mulch. this maintains consistent soil moisture and limits weed competition. do not pile mulch against the trunk of this or any other tree. - do not prune weeping alaskan cedars. just like pruning japanese maples, its lovely form is easily ruined by poor pruning technique. it ’ s best to give your weeping alaskan cedar all the room it needs. that means it will grow to its full size right from the start, and don ’ t prune it at all. - keep the tree well - watered until it ’ s established. if you site it according to its needs, once established, you won ’ t

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden
shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such"

Title: How to treat cherry tree shot hole disease by root drenching - Ask Extension
How to treat cherry tree shot hole disease by root drenching #860292
Asked March 02, 2024, 9:16 AM EST
I have a large mature Kwanza cherry tree, about 20 yrs. old that is confirmed to have
cherry shot hole disease. I have been advised to treat it with a fungicide root drench, as it is too large to spray.
After it lost all of its leaves prematurely late last summer, I raked them up and removed them from the premises, and am now ready to begin with the treatment.
Will this work? I have read several discouraging articles.
Exactly what fungicide should I apply?
Madison County Alabama
Shot hole is a fairly common bacterial disease. I wouldn’t be too discouraged. Trees can live several years without treatment, especially since your tree is an ornamental. Fruit bearing trees are typically the ones that have no hope, because when the tree sheds prematurely it affects the growth of fruit thus resulting in crop loss.
I digress. A drench fungicide can be hard to come by since there are so few available. I suggest you treat with a copper fungicide routinely. Copper based fungicides aid in preventing bacterial diseases. You can spray prior to and after petal fall. Just don’t spray when the trees are in bloom. Another consideration would be to treat the trunk of the tree in addition to the branches.
Continue to keep the area around the tree clean. That’s a great preventative measure!
https://fff.hort.purdue.edu/article/shot-hole-disease/
My tree is too large to treat with spray.
Is your advice to apply a copper fungicide routinely intended to guide me in drenching?
What copper fungicide do you recommend, and how should I use it?
There are several options for copper fungicide. Most box stores and feed & seed stores carry a copper-based fungicide. Brands include, but limited to: Bonide, Southern Ag, and Monterey.
As I mentioned earlier, I don't believe there is a drench fungicide to meet your need. I consulted with our Commercial Horticulture Agent who advises our stone fruit growers in Chilton County. He has stated that a drench application is only beneficial for soil borne diseases. Shot hole fungus is not a soil borne disease and would therefore need spray applications.
I know drenches are easy to apply but will not prove beneficial to controlling shot hole fungus."

EVIDENCE:
No, I wouldn't mow it now...wait until spring (if you want to mow at all). Mowing now can expose soil, which might reduce hardiness around the plant, leading to winterkill. These are not species that generally get snow mold and the site looks exposed and sunny. Snow mold is generally in shaded areas where the house or other structures intercept light.

User > Arctic Willow Bush Care: Our arctic willow bushes are over ten years old. They are now underneath a river birch that we planted at the same time. We're debating leaving them alone, cutting them to a few feet off the ground and letting them regrow or replacing them. I understand, however, that they need full sun, so perhaps planting them under a tree is not a great plan. They don't look particularly healthy to me. I often lop off a lot of dead branches. I'd appreciate suggestions from an expert on the pros and cons of our options.

Title: Weeping Alaskan Cedar: An Elegant, Easy-to-grow Evergreen Tree

are very common in the nursery trade. - chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘ pendula ’ : this is the most common cultivar found for sale, especially in the eastern us. i have two in my pennsylvania garden, and they perform beautifully. the branches are even more pendulous on this selection, with the lower branches often touching the ground. it ’ s quite an elegant evergreen tree. this variety grows to 35 feet tall and 12 feet wide. - chamaecyparis nootkatensis ‘ green arrow ’ : known commonly as the green arrow weeping alaskan cedar, this variety grows into a very narrow spire. with a height of 20 feet and a width of a mere 2 feet, ‘ green arrow ’ is the best selection for small yards and gardens, or for narrow areas along a driveway or fence. it creates a strong, vertical accent in the landscape. where to plant a weeping alaskan cedar because these beautiful trees grow so large and their graceful branches spread wide, don ’ t try to sandwich them into a small space ( unless of course you ’ re growing the small - space cultivar ‘ green arrow ’ ). give these trees plenty of room to show off. choose a site that receives full sun throughout most of the day. the ideal location should have moist soil, but not waterlogged. consistently moist soil is key, so if you have a low - lying area, this tree is a great choice. however, standing water is a big no - no. also try to choose a location that ’ s protected from harsh winter winds. strong winds can cause needle or branch desiccation and even die - back if winters are extremely cold and windy where you live. though the weeping alaskan cedar is very cold hardy, it does not do well in high - wind areas. problems with chamaecyparis nootkatensis thankfully, there are few problems that plague the weeping alaskan cedar. their pest resistance is yet another reason to love this tree. it has no serious pests in the landscape, though occasionally i find a bagworm or two clinging to the branches. upon occasion, spruce mites can be problematic. however, if you encourage a good population of beneficial insects in your garden by including lots of flowering plants, mite numbers seldom become an issue. the weeping alaskan cedar is also fairly tolerant of road - side pollution, though i suggest keeping it away from sidewalks, roads, and driveways that are routinely treated with road salt in the winter time. or, use a plant - and pet - safe ice melter to protect your plants from damage. caring for a weeping alaskan cedar thankfully, these trees need very little in terms of care and maintenance. - keep the plant mulched with a 2 - to 3 - inch layer of shredded hardwood mulch. this maintains consistent soil moisture and limits weed competition. do not pile mulch against the trunk of this or any other tree. - do not prune weeping alaskan cedars. just like pruning japanese maples, its lovely form is easily ruined by poor pruning technique. it ’ s best to give your weeping alaskan cedar all the room it needs. that means it will grow to its full size right from the start, and don ’ t prune it at all. - keep the tree well - watered until it ’ s established. if you site it according to its needs, once established, you won ’ t

User > My mophead hydrangeas and my lacecap hydrangeas have some sort of fungus this year and have not bloomed at all. My other ones that are immediately adjacent - oak leaf and annabelles seem to be doing fine. We have had lots of rain and they started having spots on the leaves about a month ago. I first tried an insecticide but it did not seem to help. Then I went to a garden center who advised me to remove as many leaves with spots as possible and then apply natria on the leaves, starting from below and then the top side of the leaves. I went away for a few days (lots more rain) and came home this weekend, and the leaves just look awful. I'm distressed about the fungus on my hydrangeas - it's now all over all the plants (it's a row of five bushes). They are also very dense plants, up against a screened in porch. Please tell me what do you advise - should I take them all the way down to the ground? The lace cap, in particular, looks really bad - the leaves almost look as if they are burned. Should I do anything to the soil? How can I ensure the fungus doesn't spread to the ones that are healthy?

Title: 8 Spring Lawn Care Tips for Rochester
nto treat fairy ring : - if all you see are mushrooms, use a rake to remove them. if the damage is worse, you will need to dig about a foot deep to remove the infected soil. then just refill and re - seed this area of your lawn. unfortunately, the fungus that causes fairy rings can be deep - rooted, so fungicides won ’ t help. - snow mold is another type of fungal disease, but it comes in two forms : gray snow mold and pink snow mold. gray snow mold appears as bleached, circular patches that reach up to 2 feet wide. once the snow melts, grass will have a matted appearance. it also may be surrounded by a ring of grayish - white fungal growth. pink snow mold also appears in similar - sized bleached, circular patches. however, pink snow mold has a more pinkish tint. snow mold occurs with melting snow or during cold, wet weather. how to treat snow mold : - apply fungicide and rake the mold away. active ingredients that work with both gray and pink snow mold include azoxystrobin, bacillus subtilis, and propiconazole. thiophanate - methyl can help with pink snow mold. it ’ s important to distinguish between the types of snow mold because they are treated with different fungicides. - red thread is a disease that can spread across your lawn, covering it with irregular - sized, red - pink patches. infected blades will die and turn tan. you might be able to spot red thread early, which appears as water - soaked patches of grass. it mostly affects bluegrasses, fescues, and ryegrasses that are growing in nitrogen - deficient soil. it occurs in spring and fall during warm, humid weather. how to treat red thread : - red thread will respond well to most fungicides. - brown patch is a fungal disease that causes unsightly patches of gray or brown grass. these patches can be circular or irregular - shaped, and range in size from a couple of inches to several feet. it sometimes forms a “ smoke ring ” — a gray and white band — around the patch. brown patch emerges during hot and humid weather, and cool - season grasses will start showing symptoms in late spring. how to treat brown patch : - use a fungicide that includes myclobutanil, maneb, pcnb, triadimefon, thiophanate - methyl, or propiconazole to kill the brown patch before it continues to spread. the best time to dethatch is early spring after all the snow has melted. this is when the grass has started growing and the soil is extremely moist from melted snow. thatch is a layer of dead grass shoots that is tightly interwoven with living grass. it is beneficial in small amounts, making the lawn a little bouncy and increasing its resiliency. thatch occurs when grass is growing so rapidly that there isn ’ t quite enough time for dead grass to decompose. thatch buildup can lead to several devastating problems : - it hosts insects that cause disease. - it prevents proper root growth. - it keeps nutrients from being absorbed in the soil. - it can hold onto moisture and increase fungal growth and disease. signs of thatch buildup include dry spots, increased pests and disease, and decreased grass resilience. you can dethatch using

Title: Shot Hole Disease: Treatment and Prevention - The Farm at Green Village
Shot hole disease, or coryneum blight, is caused by the fungus Wilsonomyces carpophilus. It is most commonly found on Prunus spp. hosts including almonds, Catalina and Japanese flowering cherries, English laurel, ornamental plums, nectarines, peaches, and especially apricot trees.
SYMPTOMS AND IDENTIFICATION
- Affects fruits, buds, and stems, but is most obvious on the leaves.
- First appear as small red spots on leaves which enlarge and become purple with a white center.
- Spots then drop out of the leaf to leave a BB-sized “shothole.” 
- Numerous holes result from severe infections, making leaves look tattered.
- Fruit infections appear as purple-red spots on the skin which produce scab-like spots on fruit skin and cause the skin to crack and ooze.
- Infections on fruit nearing harvest produce sunken greyish lesions.
- Infections can occur via fungal spores from spring to fall.
- Rainy weather spreads spores from infected tissue to leaves and fruit by splashed water and wind-blown rain.
TREATMENT AND PREVENTION
Prevent foliage from getting wet by using:
- Low-volume sprinklers
- Sprinkler deflectors
- Pruning off lower branches
Prune and dispose of diseased plant tissue as soon as it appears.
Apply fixed copper fungicides or certain synthetic fungicides such as chlorothalonil. It may be necessary to repeat treatment in late winter before buds swell or between full bloom/petal fall on highly susceptible apricots, or if the spring sees extended wet weather conditions.

Title: Dianthus Diseases | Plant Addicts
Dianthus are flowering plants that grow as perennials in warm zones but are often planted as annuals in other areas. Various diseases, including fungal and bacterial infections, can impact Dianthus. Some diseases are severe and can cause death, but others are treatable. It is essential to identify a diseased Dianthus to contain the outbreak and prevent future issues.
Dianthus Vascular Wilt
Vascular wilt is caused by different fungi that attack the vascular system, which is how the plant transports water and sap through the stems and foliage. Infected plants slowly die as water and nutrients are cut off to certain parts of the Dianthus, and the disease overtakes the plant.
Identifying Vascular Wilt
Dianthus plants infected with vascular wilt slowly wither before succumbing to the disease. Leaves lose their luster and turn yellow before wilting and dying. Lower leaves are the first to wilt, and the damage progresses through the rest of the plant.
Treating Vascular Wilt
Treating vascular wilt is challenging because fungicides applied to the plant's exterior do not help. Prevention is the best form of treatment. Keep plants healthy by providing regular water in the summer months and ensuring the planting site drains well. Remove an infected Dianthus and destroy the plant to prevent the spread of the fungal infection. Also, remove and replace the soil because the fungus can live in the ground and infect future plantings.
Dianthus Anthracnose
Anthracnose is a fungal disease that can stunt the growth of a Dianthus and ultimately kill the plant if left unchecked. The fungus slowly engulfs the entire plant, killing vegetation from the bottom and working its way to the top.
Identifying Anthracnose
A Dianthus infected with anthracnose will develop spots on lower leaves. With time, those leaves will turn brown and wilt. The dead vegetation will later develop black spots. The irregular-shaped black spots are the fungus reproducing. This fungal infection will spread through the plant and can be fatal.
Treating Anthracnose
Treat anthracnose on Dianthus by removing infected foliage at the first sign. Apply a fungicide to kill the fungus and contain the spread. It may take several applications of fungicide to resolve the issue entirely, so reapply every couple of weeks.
Damp conditions, especially heavy rainfall, can contribute to an anthracnose outbreak. Properly space plants to allow adequate air circulation around foliage and avoid overhead watering when possible. Apply a thin layer of mulch around the base of the plant to prevent water from splashing onto the plants.

Title: How to treat cherry tree shot hole disease by root drenching - Ask Extension
How to treat cherry tree shot hole disease by root drenching #860292
Asked March 02, 2024, 9:16 AM EST
I have a large mature Kwanza cherry tree, about 20 yrs. old that is confirmed to have
cherry shot hole disease. I have been advised to treat it with a fungicide root drench, as it is too large to spray.
After it lost all of its leaves prematurely late last summer, I raked them up and removed them from the premises, and am now ready to begin with the treatment.
Will this work? I have read several discouraging articles.
Exactly what fungicide should I apply?
Madison County Alabama
Shot hole is a fairly common bacterial disease. I wouldn’t be too discouraged. Trees can live several years without treatment, especially since your tree is an ornamental. Fruit bearing trees are typically the ones that have no hope, because when the tree sheds prematurely it affects the growth of fruit thus resulting in crop loss.
I digress. A drench fungicide can be hard to come by since there are so few available. I suggest you treat with a copper fungicide routinely. Copper based fungicides aid in preventing bacterial diseases. You can spray prior to and after petal fall. Just don’t spray when the trees are in bloom. Another consideration would be to treat the trunk of the tree in addition to the branches.
Continue to keep the area around the tree clean. That’s a great preventative measure!
https://fff.hort.purdue.edu/article/shot-hole-disease/
My tree is too large to treat with spray.
Is your advice to apply a copper fungicide routinely intended to guide me in drenching?
What copper fungicide do you recommend, and how should I use it?
There are several options for copper fungicide. Most box stores and feed & seed stores carry a copper-based fungicide. Brands include, but limited to: Bonide, Southern Ag, and Monterey.
As I mentioned earlier, I don't believe there is a drench fungicide to meet your need. I consulted with our Commercial Horticulture Agent who advises our stone fruit growers in Chilton County. He has stated that a drench application is only beneficial for soil borne diseases. Shot hole fungus is not a soil borne disease and would therefore need spray applications.
I know drenches are easy to apply but will not prove beneficial to controlling shot hole fungus."

User > Camille fungus? I have winter blooming Camilles in a part sunny, mostly shady spot. Every spring when new growth appears, 90 percent of the new leaves are thick and waxy. Last year I pruned the bushes so that air could get through, but still the problem. I keep the ground clear and use appropriate acidic fertilizer. Once I cut off all the waxy new growth, the bush is fine for the rest of the year, although I have at times noticed a white powdery substance on the bottom of leaves. Then I prune and spray. Any other ideas to fix the problem?

User > I have two deciduous magnolias that were blooming during the February freeze. They are starting to bud out again to bloom and I can tell where the dead branches are by the lack of blooms. The bulk of the dead branches are at the ends of the main trunks (highlighted with red lines in the attached photos). I understand that when you prune deciduous magnolias, you should prune back to a fork. In this case, pruning back to a fork will take the main trunks back to the ground. Both trees have new, small trunks growing from the bases of the larger trunks (highlighted with yellow lines in the attached photos). I have two questions: 1. Is it better to cut the large trunks back to the ground and allow the smaller trunks to grow in their place? 2. Is now an appropriate time to do the pruning or is it too late in the fall?

damaged. however, it is possible to prune some types of magnolia trees very lightly to shape them. when to prune magnolia trees are you wondering when to prune a magnolia? the best time to do so is in the period between mid - summer and late fall. this is the period when magnolias go dormant. if you trim the trees in late winter or spring, the pruning wounds are likely to bleed sap. how to prune a magnolia tree if you are wondering how to prune a magnolia tree, first ask if you should prune at all. young evergreen magnolias can be pruned at planting to shape the tree. simply cut back lengthy branches. once they are grown, they should generally not be pruned. pruning to shape them is not required. they evolve into their mature shape slowly, so just step back and let it happen. with deciduous magnolias, prune them lightly to shape them if you must. if you need to reduce the size of a magnolia, remove selected branches. when you do so, aim to keep the crown balanced and open by pruning stems back to the trunk. space any sizing pruning over a few years rather than all at once to avoid weakening the tree. keep in mind that pruning can stress the trees, and it is better to prune too little than too much. frequently asked questions can young magnolia be pruned to shape? sign up for the gardening know how newsletter today and receive a free copy of our e -

third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythias may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such\n\nTitle: How to Prune Japanese Maples - PlantingTree\n\nsunny days, as it causes more shock damage to the tree. with respect to timing, one question we commonly get is whether or not you can prune in the spring and fall. the answer is yes you can, however, it ’ s a good practice to be cautious when pruning at these times. pruning too heavily in the spring can cause damage to new buds and stunt growth. whereas pruning too late in the season can stimulate new growth which can be quickly damaged by freezing late fall temperatures where to cut when pruning the purpose of pruning is to encourage your tree ’ s natural growth habit. that being said, there are 5 types of branches you may want to consider removing from your japanese maple. - broken, diseased, or dead branches. these need to go for obvious reasons. prune them when you see them, no matter the time of year. - branches growing inward or in the wrong direction. while strange - looking branches can add character to a tree, they can also cause a lot of problems, particularly if they are growing inward. - crossing branches can result in damage to both the bark and the branches. this can encourage disease and pests, which is something you don ’ t want. if you find that you have several branches crossing in one area, you may consider removing a branch or two. - narrow crotches. this is where two branches meet at an angle of less than 45 degrees. remove one of the branches to open up your tree and reduce the possibility of breakage. - crowded branches. removing crowded branches is most important when it involves the crown of the tree. when you remove crowded branches and foliage in this area, it will increase airflow and help your tree breathe better. you can thin these areas by removing one out of every four branches or so. pruning tips & tricks where you cut matters when removing an entire branch, prune at a 45 - degree angle back to the branch collar, but not into it. basically, there shouldn ’ t be much of the branch left but you should never cut flush to the connecting branch or trunk. be sure to use clean, professional pruners for the best results. - do not prune young trees unless absolutely necessary. allow your tree to fully develop and grow into itself for 10 to 15 years before you do any serious pruning. - younger trees often get long, thin, whip - like branches. you may be tempted to prune off these scrawny long branches. however, it ’ s better if you don ’ t. be patient. they will fill out and get lateral branches. if you prune them off you are more likely to get even more of this same branch type. - don ’ t buy a japanese maple that grows too tall for the spot you have chosen. pruning japanese maples to control height is a fight you won ’ t win. it will only encourage faster growth and thinner, weaker branches. - do not prune off more than of the foliage or the crown of your japanese maple. - never over - prune. while aesthetic pruning of japanese maples is certainly an acceptable practice, we advise that you prune when necessary. believe it or not, sometimes less really is more. now you know how to prune japanese maples. just remember to be patient, take your time, and a little pruning maintenance can go a long way. plantingtree\n\nTitle: How to Prune Hibiscus for Blooms That Last All Summer | Gardening Know How\n\ntomatoes \\\". if you plan on overwintering your hibiscus plants in a cool, dark location, such as a basement, you can wait until spring to prune. if you grow hibiscus indoors all year, trim plants in late winter. for outdoor hibiscus plants, timing depends on your climate. if you live in a region with cold winters, it ’ s best to prune in spring after the danger of frost has passed. the shrub will be more vulnerable to cold damage if you create cuts and wounds in cold weather. if you live in a warmer climate, you can prune your hibiscus in the fall. but in either situation, the best timing for a complete overhaul is in the spring after the threat of frost has passed. this will prepare them for a growth spurt in spring. any hard pruning, such as rejuvenation pruning, should always be performed in the spring as well. you can also remove dead or damaged stems at any time of the year, as soon as you notice them. how to prune hibiscus start your pruning task with a sharp, clean pair of shears, like these bestselling pruners from fiskars. as a general rule, never trim off more than one - third of the plant. you can trim less than that ’ s all that is needed, but avoid doing more unless your plant has been neglected for years and needs a major refresh. make cuts at an angle of about 45 degrees and about 0. 25 inch ( 0. 5 cm ) above a leaf node. if your shrub is already mostly upright, make cuts above leaf nodes that face outwards. if the shrub has horizontal growth that you want to train upwards, cut above inward - facing leaf nodes. you can direct a new branch to grow to the left or right by cutting above a node on the left side of a branch or on the right side, respectively. avoid making too many inward - facing cuts. this directs growth toward the center of the plant, which can help you get an upright structure, but which can also cause too much dense growth in the center. this can reduce airflow and promote common hibiscus diseases. when choosing stems to trim, look for the longest ones. trim them at a node that is about one - third of the way down the stem. choose strategically to create a shape that will be even and neat. for example, if you have more growth on one side of the shrub, making it appear lopsided, make more cuts on that side. different ways to prune hibiscus depending on your plant's needs and your own desired look, there are a few different techniques for pruning hibiscus : - some light pruning will encourage more flowers to grow on your hibiscus. to do this, pinch off growing tips in the spring and even into summer. pinch off about 0. 25 to 1 inch ( 0. 5 to 2. 5 cm ) of growth. this is an especially useful type of pruning for young plants, as it will train them to grow fuller and in an even shape. - for a full prune, cut each stem back by about a third to two or three nodes. this will promote branching, blooming, and a pleasing shape. however, blooming will be delayed till the new growth forms. - for selective pruning, only remove one - third or less of the stems from the base. this will allow some stems to continue blooming, while the rest are developing. - if you have an old, neglected hibiscus shrub, you can cut more severely. trim all of the stems down to about 1 foot ( 30 cm ) off the ground to encourage new, healthier growth. be sure the remaining stems have some leaves on them. trimming hibiscus into a tree hibiscus is a shrub, but with the right pruning, you can prune your shrub into a small tree. look for one large, strong stem to use as the “ trunk ” of the tree. it should be at least 2 feet ( 0. 6 m ) tall. trim it off by about 2 inches ( 5 cm ) and then trim back all the lower branches. trim back all the upper stems on your primary trunk to create a ball shape on the top. this will be the top of your tree. make sure these stems still have two or three nodes after trimming and that they are about 6 inches ( 30 cm ) long. maintain the shape by trimming off lower branches as they form. pruning hibiscus is a necessary garden chore, but you don ’ t have to do it every year. prune lightly for more flowers and to remove any damaged or dead branches yearly, and do a more vigorous pruning every few years for the best results. frequently asked questions do you need to cut back hibiscus every year? if you have a containerized hibiscus that you overwinter indoors, it will benefit from annual pruning. if your hibiscus shrubs are outdoors year - round and they did not suffer any frost damage, you can decide if you want to skip pruning that year. can you prune hibiscus in summer? you can pinch off the tips in summer to encourage fullness and you can “ fix ” any protruding stems that look awkward by cutting them back. you also can lightly shape the plant if needed. shop pruning essentials make the perfect cut for quick & easy cleanup mary ellen ellis has been gardening for over 20 years. with degrees in chemistry and biology, mary ellen's specialties are flowers, native plants, and herbs. -

User > We have a Spring Snow fruitless crab apple tree, about 14 years old. For the first time ever, it produced small crab apples this year, and we are wondering why? Is it likely to continue? And if so, is there anything we can do to prevent it from happening as we would rather not have the apples in the yard and flower bed? Also, is that a fungus or moss on the bark of the tree?

User: Can you help me identify this? I have these yellow flowers that sprang up in my meadow. I'm trying to identify them to decide if I should encourage their growth (native and/or wildlife friendly) or get rid of them (invasive alien). I've searched multiple wildflower databases and can't find an exact match. It has multiple flower clusters with four-petal flowers and a few pistils. Grows in full sun, the plant is over a foot tall.

It appears to have spread into not only the back but front lawn this time. I did not treat it with fungicide until this year (roughly 3 weeks ago). How soon after treating with fungicide will it be safe to fertilize?

"EVIDENCE:
Title: Shot Hole, or Coryneum Blight / Home and Landscape / UC Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM)

Shot hole disease affects Prunus spp. Hosts include almonds, Catalina and Japanese flowering cherries, English laurel, ornamental plums, nectarines, peaches, and especially apricot. The disease will develop on cherries, plums, and prunes only when growing near more susceptible hosts during years with unusually wet weather during winter and spring.

Shot hole first appears in the spring as purplish or reddish spots about 1/10 inch in diameter on new buds, leaves, and shoots. Spots on young leaves commonly have a narrow, light green or yellow margin. The spots expand and their centers turn brown and can drop out, leaving holes.

The fungal disease also causes premature leaf drop, rough and corky or scabby lesions on fruit that are brown with dark purple margins and mostly on the upper surface, and small cankers on branches. Tiny, dark specks (sporodochium and spores) visible with a hand lens form in the centers of brown spots, especially on buds; these dark fungal spores help to distinguish shot hole from other diseases.

The fungus overwinters in infected buds and twig lesions. The spores spread in splashing water. Disease is most severe following warm, foggy or rainy winters and when it rains in the spring during young leaf growth.

Spores that land on twigs, buds, blossoms, or young leaves require 24 hours of continuous wetness to cause infection. Only the current season's growth is susceptible to infection. In California, twig and bud infections of apricot, nectarine, and peach can occur during rainy weather any time between fall and spring. Buds of peach, nectarine, and sometimes apricot are killed in the winter. The fungus can germinate and infect at temperatures as low as 36°F.

When zinc sulfate is sprayed on foliage in late October to early November to hasten leaf fall, shot hole inoculum is prevented from increasing. Otherwise, high levels of inoculum may develop and overwinter on the trees, infecting leaves the following spring.

Use low-volume sprinklers, drip irrigation, or sprinkler deflectors and prune off lower branches to prevent foliage wetting from irrigation. Prune and dispose of infected plant tissue as soon as it appears. After leaf drop, inspect plants carefully and prune varnished-appearing (infected) buds and twigs with lesions. Diligent sanitation and directing irrigation water away from foliage provide adequate control where the incidence of shot hole is low.

Where disease is severe on high-value plants, Bordeaux mixture, fixed copper, or certain synthetic fungicides such as chlorothalonil can be applied after leaf drop. Retreatment in late winter before buds swell or between full bloom and petal fall or both times may be necessary on highly susceptible apricot or if prolonged wet weather occurs in the spring."

I have had years with an abundance of apples and others with literally 10.

Title: Pruning Large, Overgrown Shrubs | Yard and Garden

shrubs are valuable assets to a home landscape. shrubs are often planted for their ornamental characteristics, such as flowers, colorful fall foliage, or attractive fruit. they also can provide privacy, block views, and attract wildlife. for shrubs to perform well in the landscape, home gardeners must prune them properly. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. many deciduous shrubs ( those that lose their leaves in the fall ) can be kept healthy and vigorous by removing a few of the largest, oldest stems every 2 or 3 years. unfortunately, many individuals fail to prune their shrubs because they lack time, knowledge, or courage. as a result of this neglect, shrubs often become leggy and unattractive. flowering shrubs that are not pruned properly may not bloom well. rejuvenation pruning | renovation pruning | overgrown hedges | overgrown evergreens | more information rejuvenation pruning proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. one method is to prune them back over three years. begin by removing one - third of the large, old stems at ground level in late winter / early spring ( march or early april ). the following year ( again in march or early april ), prune out one - half of the remaining old stems. also, thin out some of the new growth. retain several well - spaced, vigorous shoots and remove all of the others. finally, remove all of the remaining old wood in late winter / early spring of the third year. additional thinning of new shoots should also be done. this method of rejuvenation pruning works well for any multi - stemmed or cane - type shrub, such as lilac, forsythia, beautybush, mockorange, viburnum, and dogwood. a second way to prune overgrown, deciduous shrubs is to cut them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in march or early april. this severe pruning will induce a large number of shoots to develop during the growing season. spring - blooming shrubs will sacrifice that season's flowers since they are set in the fall and removed in the renovation process. in late winter of the following year, select and retain several strong, healthy shoots and remove all others at ground level. head ( cut ) back the retained shoots to encourage branching. large, overgrown lilacs, honeysuckles, dogwoods, spireas, barberry, flowering quince, ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia may be pruned in this manner. spring - blooming shrubs like ninebark, smokebush, and forsythia will not bloom the following spring after renovation pruning. some shrubs, such as lilacs, pruned by this method, will not bloom for 3 to 5 years. pruning overgrown hedges deciduous, formal hedges ( those pruned to a definite size and shape ), such as privets, that become open and leggy also can be rejuvenated by pruning them back to within 4 to 6 inches of the ground in late winter / early spring. to obtain a full, thick hedge, prune ( shear ) the shoots often as they grow back in spring and summer. also, make sure the base of the hedge is slightly wider than the top to encourage growth close to the ground. other species, such as boxwood and holly, can be pruned in this manner. pruning overgrown shrubs properly can improve their health, appearance, and productivity. proper pruning helps to maintain plant health, control or shape plant growth, and stimulate flower production. proper pruning can renew or rejuvenate overgrown, deciduous shrubs. pruning overgrown hedges can also improve their health and appearance. proper pruning helps

User > I planted four candy coralberry shrubs this spring, and they all started out doing well. However, I noticed that two of them now have nearly bare bottom branches, with thinning foliage on top as well. Is there something I should do to care for the candy coralberry shrubs? Or wait until spring? Photos are attached.

Title: Plant Identification Guides
Plant identification guides can aid biologists with proper identification of plant species in the field, such as when determining whether an area meets the criteria for classification as a wetland, or in assessing the floristic quality of a site for natural areas protection.
The Commission has also prepared lists of plants suitable for landscaping in Southeastern Wisconsin. Landscaping guides and invasive species eradication information can be found on the Zoning & Ordinances page.

Title: Grass Indentification – Grass Barrier
grass indentification identifying grasses can be a challenging task due to the numerous species and subtle differences between them. however, by examining specific characteristics of the grass, such as leaf shape, growth habit, and inflorescences, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify the grass species. here are some key features to observe when trying to identify grasses : - leaf blade : observe the shape, width, and texture of the leaf blade. some grasses have fine, needle - like leaves, while others have broader leaves. the leaf blade's edges may be smooth, serrated, or have tiny hairs. additionally, note the color and any distinct patterns, such as stripes or a change in color along the midrib. - leaf sheath and ligule : the leaf sheath is the part of the leaf that wraps around the stem, while the ligule is a small projection at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath. the presence, shape, and size of the ligule can be an important identifying feature. - growth habit : observe how the grass grows, whether it forms clumps ( bunch - type ) or spreads through stolons or rhizomes ( creeping - type ). the growth habit can help narrow down the species or group of grasses. - vernation : this refers to how the grass leaf is folded or rolled in the bud. some grasses have leaves that are folded, while others have leaves rolled in the bud. this characteristic can be helpful in distinguishing between different species. - inflorescence : the inflorescence is the flowering part of the grass. note the shape, size, and arrangement of the flower spikelets. grass inflorescences can be spike - like, panicle - like, or raceme - like, with various branching patterns. - seed head : examine the seed head's shape, size, and color, as well as the arrangement and appearance of the seeds or spikelets. - stems : observe the shape, size, and color of the grass stems. some grasses have round stems, while others have flattened or triangular stems. the stem joints or nodes may also be swollen or constricted, which can be a useful identifying feature. - root system : although not always practical, examining the root system can provide additional clues. some grasses have fibrous root systems, while others have rhizomes or stolons. - habitat and region : consider the grass's habitat, as certain species are more likely to be found in specific environments, such as wetlands, forests, or prairies. additionally, note the region and climate where the grass is growing, as some grasses are native to particular areas or thrive in specific climates. to identify grasses, it is helpful to consult a field guide or online resources that provide images and descriptions of grass species in your region. by comparing the observed characteristics with the information in these resources, you can often determine the grass species or at least narrow it down to a small group of possibilities. identifying characteristics of the most common lawn grasses kentucky bluegrass ( poa pratensis ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a boat - shaped tip, and a prominent midrib on the upper side. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads through rhizomes, creating a dense, interconnected turf. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : pyramid - shaped panicle with branches that spread outward, containing small spikelets on delicate stalks. - color : deep green to bluish - green. bermudagrass ( cynodon dactylon ) - leaf blade : narrow, flat, and slightly rough on the upper side, with a pointed tip. - growth habit : spreads vigorously through both stolons and rhizomes. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a finger - like arrangement of spikes radiating from a central point, with each spike containing several spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. zoysiagrass ( zoysia spp. ) - leaf blade : narrow, stiff, and sharp, with a fine texture and a tapering tip. the upper side of the leaf blade is often hairy near the base. - growth habit : spreads through both stolons and rhizomes, creating a dense turf. - vernation : rolled. - inflorescence : a slender, branched panicle containing small spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. st. augustine grass ( stenotaphrum secundatum ) - leaf blade : broad, flat, and relatively coarse, with a rounded or tapering tip. the leaf edges may have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : spreads primarily through stolons, forming a dense, carpet - like lawn. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a spike - like raceme containing several spikelets, often with a purplish hue. - color : medium to dark green. fescue grass ( festuca spp. ) - includes fine fescue and tall fescue - leaf blade : fine fescue has very narrow, needle - like leaves, while tall fescue has broader leaves with a prominent midrib. both have a slightly rough texture on the upper side. - growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps. - vernation : rolled ( fine fescue ) or folded ( tall fescue ). - inflorescence : fine fescue has a panicle - like inflorescence, while tall fescue has a more spike - like inflorescence. both contain small spikelets. - color : medium to dark green. perennial ryegrass ( lolium perenne ) - leaf blade : narrow, with a shiny appearance on the upper side and a tapering tip. the leaf edges have a slightly rough texture. - growth habit : bunch - type growth, forming clumps. - vernation : folded. - inflorescence : a spike - like inflorescence containing spikelets that are arranged alternately on a central stem. - color : bright green to dark green. by observing these identifying characteristics, you can distinguish between the most common lawn grasses and better understand their growth habits and appearance. keep in mind that variations can occur within each species, and hybrid cultivars may exhibit unique features.

level, but it doesn’t hurt to cover them, just in case. a house fly is about ¼ - inches long, according to the illinois department of public health. it usually has four dark stripes in the middle of its body ( the thorax ). where you’ll find it : because they can fly nearly anywhere, house flies can be all over your home. however, they tend to gravitate toward trash and food, per the illinois department of public health. can it harm you? for the most part, you’ll usually be ok if there are a few house flies around your place — they’re super common, after all. but these flies have the ability to interfere with your food and possibly even make you sick. they feed on liquid food and have to liquify solid food by regurgitating saliva on it, according to the penn state extension. but they can leave waste around your home and are suspected to spread at least 65 diseases to people, including cholera, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever, per penn state extension. while you don’t need to panic if you spot a house fly or two around your place, it’s a good idea to try to get rid of them or at least keep them away from your food. what it looks like : wolf spiders are hunting spiders — and can be pretty big, up to an inch and a half long, marc potzler, a board - certified entomologist and technical services manager with ehrlich pest control, told prevention. they are usually black, gray, or brown, and have a hairy appearance. where you’ll find them : after mating in the fall, female wolf spiders look for protected areas to produce their egg cocoons. you’ll find them under and between boards, stones, firewood, and siding, most commonly in basements, sheds, or garages, where other insects are, says potzler. can it harm you? wolf spiders can bite, but only if they feel threatened. “ they would prefer to hide than bite, ” according to howard russell, m. s., an entomologist at michigan state university. cellar spider ( a. k. a. daddy long legs ) what it looks like : these are spindly spiders with long thin legs. the body of the cellar spider is usually 1 / 4 - 5 / 16 - inch - long, with legs extending another 2 inches. where you’ll find it : “ you’ll always find them in a corner with a cobweb, ” says raupp. their namesake matches their stomping grounds, including basements, attics, or other protected places. cellar spiders are known for their webbing, continuously adding to them. can it harm you? cellar spiders are not venomous and not known to bite. what it looks like : these crickets are light brown, tan, and dark brown with a humped back. they have very long antennae, and their bodies grow between 1 / 2 to 1 1 / 2 inches long. where you’ll find it : “ you’ll find them in the basement or dark mancave, ” says raupp, as they prefer dark, moist places. can it harm you? no. camel crickets do not bite and are not known to be harmful to humans and pets. what it looks like : when you think of a stereotypical cricket, these are the ones. adult field crickets are black and brown in color and are between 1 / 2 to 1 inch long. they have six legs, long antennae, and antennae - like appendages at the end of their abdomens called cerci. they also have hind wings. where you’ll find it : they enter buildings through open doors and windows and through cracks in foundations. you’ll likely be able to locate them through their signature chirping. can it harm you? no. field crickets do not bite or carry diseases. however, once indoors, crickets may damage clothing, drapes, or wall coverings — thanks to stains from feces or by their feeding. what they look like : these black ants are tiny. they grow between 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 inch long. when they’re crushed, they release a bad ( somewhat sweet ) odor, often described as rotten coconut or banana. where you’ll find them : odorous house ants feed on pretty much anything, but are drawn to sweet things. so, you’ll often find them near water and food sources, like garbage cans and kitchen sinks or counters. they also nest indoors near sources of warmth, commonly in wall voids near pipes or heaters. can they harm you? nope, just keep an eye on your groceries. what it looks like : carpenter ants are one of the largest ant species in north america. wingless types grow between ¼ to ½ inch, while those with wings can grow up to 1 inch. they are shiny, usually black or dark brown, and known for their narrow waists. they also have mandibles ( jaw - like appendages ) used for chomping. where you’ll find it : they often damage homes and other wooden structures, so they can be found in moist or decayed wood caused by exposure to water leaks, condensation, or poor air circulation. can it harm you? unfortunately, yes. carpenter ants can bite, and they’ve been known to break skin when they do, which can be painful. while they don’t use venom, they do inject an irritant called formic acid into the area, which may cause an allergic reaction. the bites usually don’t require medical attention but should be cleaned well to avoid any issues. western conifer seed bug what it looks like : these bugs are shaped a bit like a stink bug and grow up to 3 / 4 inch long. they are a reddish - brown color, and usually have a bright yellow or orange underside with black patches. where you’ll find it : western conifer seed bugs tend to congregate in the fall as they seek shelter for the winter. they can be found around baseboards, window and door moldings, openings for electrical outlets and fixtures, openings for heating or cooling vents, and other similar pathways. can it harm you? they do not bite or sting, but can gather in annoyingly large numbers within the home. what it looks like : while they look similar to your standard house fly, cluster flies are often larger, about ⅓ inch long. they are dull - gray and black and have golden - yellow hairs on their bodies, which give them a golden sheen and bristly texture. where you’ll find it : cluster flies head indoors to outlast the winter. you’ll likely find them in attics, under siding, and around windows and crevices on the outside of buildings. they also congregate between walls and work their way out through openings in window frames and electrical fixtures. can it harm you? cluster flies aren’t venomous and do not bite, don’t lay eggs in food like house flies, and aren’t associated with transmitting diseases. what it looks like : this creepy crawler get its name from its silvery scales and three, tail - like appendages that protrude from its abdomen. its antennae is as long as its body and can grow up to 12 mm in length. where you’ll find it : silverfish are known to feed on foods high in starches and destroy books, papers, wallpaper, and more. they are found in high - humidity environments, but are able to survive a wide range of temperatures. they usually hang out indoors in concealed, temperature - controlled areas such as bathrooms, attics, and basements. can it harm you? silverfish do not bite, do not have venom, and are not poisonous if ingested. what they look like : an adult bed bug can be anywhere from - ¼ - inch in size. “ they are often compared to the size of an apple seed, ” says nancy troyano, ph. d., a board - certified entomologist with western exterminator. bed bugs can range in color from a mahogany - red to light brown, “ depending on when they last fed, ” troyano says. where you’ll find them : in general, you’ll find them around people. “ blood is their only food source, ” says glen ramsey, a board - certified entomologist and senior technical services manager at orkin. bed bugs are normally nocturnal, and they’ll come out of hiding from places like a mattress to feed on sleeping or quietly resting people. keep in mind that bed bugs get around with the help of people, points out dan suiter, ph. d., professor of urban entomology at the university of georgia extension. “ if you find bed bugs in your home, you or someone you know who came to your home, brought them there from somewhere else, ” he says. “ they don’t just appear. ” can they harm you? yes. “ while bed bugs have not been found to transmit any diseases to humans, their bites may cause symptoms such as itching, red welts, or swelling the day after being bitten, ” ramsey says. however, “ many bites can leave no mark and go completely unnoticed. ” what it looks like : there are different types of cockroaches, but the most common are the american, german, oriental, and brown - banded cockroaches, ramsey says. “ cockroaches can measure over two inches length, with tropical species tending to be larger than those found in other climates, ” ramsey says. they have six legs, two antennae, and some even have wings. “ however, most winged cockroaches are not particularly adept at flying, ” ramsey says. where you’ll find it : you can find cockroaches in a lot of places in your home, troyano says. they could pop up in the bathroom — they love to snack on soap residue — dark places in your kitchen like cupboards and cabinets, laundry rooms, basements, and drains, she says. can it harm you? unless you have a serious infestation, cockroaches won’t bite you. while cockroaches don’t give people diseases through bites, they can transmit food - borne illnesses from one place to another. they can also trigger asthma “ because of a protein in their saliva, droppings, and on their body, ” troyano says. what they look like : fruit flies look like light brown flies, says russell. they’re usually very small — about 1 / 8 of an inch. “ there are two main types of fruit flies : the common red - eyed fruit fly and the dark - eyed fruit fly, ” ramsey says. where you’ll find them : fruit flies like to hang out around fruit and produce, especially when it’s ripe, rotting, or decayed, and they’re also attracted to fermented items like beer, liquor, and wine, ramsey says. “ fruit flies also may breed and develop in drains, garbage disposals, trash cans, and mop buckets, ” he adds. can they harm you? in general, russell says that fruit flies “ are just a nuisance. ” but they have the potential to contaminate your food with bacteria and other pathogens, ramsey says, which is why it’s so important to store produce in air - tight containers or refrigerators and inspect any fruits or vegetables brought into your home. “ also, establish a schedule to regularly clean drain lines, garbage disposals, and any location where food waste accumulates, ” he says. what it looks like : centipedes have “ long, segmented, generally flattened bodies with one pair of legs per body segment, ” russell says. they also have a pair of venomous fangs they use to take out their prey. centipedes range from 4 to 152 millimeters in size and usually are brown or a reddish orange color. where you’ll find it : “ house centipedes live in damp, undisturbed places, such as cellars, closets, bathrooms, and attics, ” troyano says. can it harm you? some types of centipedes will bite “ but do not pose a serious threat, ” troyano says. still, a bite can still lead to some swelling and a little pain"

Title: Night Moves
scott zona, former palm biologist do plants sleep? that's a question without an immediately obvious answer. a more relevant question might be : if plants did sleep, how would we know? it is becoming increasingly clear to botanists that plants experience circadian rhythms just as humans do. “ circadian ” means “ around the day, ” and this word describes rhythms or cycles that organisms experience on a daily basis. these cycles are not always sleep - like in the human sense of metabolism slowing down and the organism becoming inactive. on the contrary, a lot goes on under cover of darkness. some plants appear to shut down and go to sleep at night. sleep movements, known to botanists as “ nyctinasty, ” are especially common in certain plants of the bean family ( fabaceae ). at sundown, the leaves of these plants fold up or droop down. the corresponding unfolding of leaves comes about at dawn. bean leaves are generally compound, i. e., a single leaf is composed of several leaflets. at the base of every leaf and every leaflet lie swollen, hinge - like structures called pulvini ( singular : pulvinus ). the pulvini are specialized regions containing large, water - filled cells. the water in these cells can be pumped in or out of the pulvini, resulting in changes in turgor. as turgor is decreased, a pulvinus acts as a hinge, allowing the leaf to droop ; as turgor is increased, the leaf returns to its daytime position. the folding or drooping of leaves makes the plant look like it is “ shutting down for the day, ” so it is no wonder that nyctinasty is commonly likened to sleep. the functional or evolutionary reason behind nyctinasty is still unknown. leaves are not the only organs with circadian movements. flowers too can open at dawn and close with the setting of the sun. the tribulus cistoides is one such example : its bright yellow flowers come to life at sunrise and face into the sun. during the day, as the sun appears to move across the sky, the flowers of tribulus track the sun like little satellite dishes, reorienting themselves so that they always face into the sun. when the sun drops below the horizon, the flowers close. some species of day - flowering plants can open and close their flowers for several days in succession. the setting of the sun does not always bring about the closure of flowers. indeed, it can have quite the opposite effect. nightfall is the cue for many plants to begin reproductive activity. four - o ’ clocks ( mirabilis jalapa ) earn their common name from the time at which their flowers open, about four o ’ clock in the afternoon. ( the ones in my garden, for some reason, seem to be on greenwich mean time — they don't open until around nine o ’ clock at night. ) four - o ’ clocks are pollinated by evening - flying moths that are attracted to the sweet fragrance of the flowers. the african baobabs ( adansonia digitata ) announce their flowering to garden visitors by dropping withered and brown flowers onto the tram path beneath the trees. one has to observe the tree at night to see the dazzling white flowers at their best. shine a flashlight into the crown of the tree to see the fluffy white flowers dangling singly from the branches.

User > Do you know what causes this weird texture in my apples and how I can prevent it in the future? I have enclosed a picture of a peeled Granny Smith apple. The half on the left has a peculiar texture but the half of the same apple on the right is perfectly normal. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the apple before I peeled it. I also had this same issue with quite a few of my Red Rome Beauty apples.

Title: Apple Tree Pests: Identification and Treatment — Raintree Nursery
\n\nintervention are crucial to keeping these pests under control and ensuring the health of your apple tree. aphids are a widespread issue for apple trees and are easily recognized by their small green or black bodies. they tend to gather on new shoots and buds, feeding on the sap of the tree. this feeding causes the leaves to curl and can stunt the overall growth of the tree. one of the most noticeable signs of an aphid infestation is apple tree leaves turning yellow, which indicates that the tree is under stress from the loss of nutrients. left unchecked, aphids can weaken your apple tree, making it more susceptible to other diseases and pests. regular monitoring and natural control methods can help prevent serious damage. apple - leaf blister mites apple - leaf blister mites are tiny pests that cause noticeable red or yellow blisters on the leaves of your apple tree. while the damage is mostly cosmetic, a severe infestation can weaken the tree over time. this weakening can result in reduced fruit production as the tree's energy is diverted toward recovering from the mite damage. apple - leaf blister mites are particularly problematic in young trees or in cases where the infestation goes untreated. regular inspection of leaves for blistering can help catch the problem early, ensuring that your tree stays healthy and productive. speckled green fruitworm speckled green fruitworms are caterpillars that feed on apple tree leaves and fruit. if you notice chunks missing from your apples, you may have these critters on your hands. how to keep apple tree pests at bay keeping apple tree pests at bay is essential for maintaining a healthy and productive tree. prevention is always easier than dealing with a full - blown infestation. here are some effective natural strategies to protect your apple trees : - prune regularly : remove damaged or dead branches where pests may hide or lay eggs. this keeps your tree healthy and makes it harder for pests to establish themselves. - encourage beneficial insects : ladybugs and lacewings prey on harmful pests like aphids. introducing or attracting these beneficial insects to your garden can naturally control pest populations. - use organic treatments : spray neem oil or horticultural soap on your tree to suffocate and repel pests. these organic solutions are effective without harming beneficial insects or the environment. - net your apple trees : netting is an excellent organic method to prevent pests, such as apple maggot flies, from laying eggs on your apples. it is a simple but highly effective way to safeguard your fruit. - keep the area clean : clear away fallen leaves, fruit, and other debris around the tree. this prevents pests from using the ground as a breeding site and helps reduce the chances of reinfestation. these methods will help keep your apple tree healthy and free from common pests. organic vs. chemical control : what's best for your apple trees? when it comes to pest control for your apple trees, there are two primary options : organic and chemical. our findings show that while chemical treatments can be highly effective at quickly eliminating pests, they come with drawbacks, such as potentially harming beneficial insects and negatively impacting the environment. organic methods, such as using neem oil, insecticidal soap, or introducing natural predators, offer a safer, more environmentally sustainable approach. these methods work well for most situations, though they may require more frequent application. in cases of severe infestations, chemical treatments may be necessary to prevent significant damage to your trees. ultimately, it's about finding the right balance between protecting your apple trees and aligning with your gardening values. dealing with apple tree pests can feel overwhelming, but with the right strategies in place, your apple trees will remain healthy and productive for years to come. from tackling apple tree rust treatment to addressing orange spots on apple tree leaves, knowing how to manage pests is crucial for a thriving harvest. if you're looking for the best disease resistant apple trees or more tips on how to keep bugs off apple trees naturally, raintree nursery has a wide selection of varieties and expert resources to guide you. as trusted experts in home gardening, we're committed to helping you grow the healthiest, most productive apple trees possible. visit raintree nursery today to explore our options and get started on your journey to successful apple growing! if you want to learn more, why not check out this article below : - will apples ripen off the tree - pruning apple trees - how long does it take for an apple tree to grow?

Title: Orange Fungus on Evergreens - Salisbury Greenhouse - Blog
\n\nAll About Juniper-Hawthorne Rust
\n\nWhile wet weather makes for lush gardens, it can also create the perfect conditions for some bizarre and unsightly garden problems. If you’ve seen alien looking, orange tentacles blobs sitting in your junipers or cedars, you know what I’m talking about.
\n\nConcerned gardeners are bringing scores of samples and stories of Juniper-Hawthorne rust into the greenhouse daily. It’s a fungal disease that, while not fatal to infected plants, does make certain plants look like they’ve been “slimed.”
\n\nJuniper-Hawthorne rust is closely related to Cedar-Apple rust; the only thing that really differentiates them is the plants they infect. They need two specific hosts to complete their two year life cycle.
\n\nIf your junipers are infected (or your cedars with Cedar-Apple), you would have noticed gelatinous orange blobs hanging off the branches in June. They look like orange octopuses, with slimy tentacles (called teliohorns) dangling from the main gooey mass.
\n\nEach teliohorn has thousands of spores inside of it just waiting to catch a ride on the breeze and ride through the garden. When they mature in mid summer, the dispersing spores can only latch on to a specific secondary host.
\n\nIn the case of Juniper-Hawthorne rust, the spores travel from their primary host (junipers) to their secondary hosts (hawthorne, mountain ash, and apples). With Cedar-Apple rust, the spores travel from cedars to apples, mountain ash, pears, and saskatoons.
\n\nThe secondary hosts don’t acquire the gelatinous teliohorns. They get rust spots on their leaves that are orange with dark red to black centers. In the late summer, a different kind of spore blows from the secondary host back to the primary, where it lurks over winter until it can re-emerge in the spring.
\n\nDamage and Prevention
\n\nThe good news is that this disease, thought disgusting, won’t cause significant damage to your juniper. The bad news is that if it hits your apple trees hard it can lead to significant defoliation and a reduced fruit yield.
\n\nThere is no magic bullet. The disease starts as a gall on juniper or cedar stems in the late summer. From there, the jelly tentacles won’t emerge till the next spring so you have time to cut it out. If you or your neighbours have had the disease, look for a brown-orange gall on your evergreen stems in late summer.
\n\nWhether you can catch the growing gall or find the unmistakable orange blob the next spring, it’s important to remove the growth before it spores and damages the secondary hosts. Cut all infected branches 8 inches from the growth. Burn the fungus and disinfect your tools with a light bleach solution.
\n\nIf it’s already on your apples, Hawthorne, and ash trees, remove as many infected leaves as feasible. The fewer leaves there are, the fewer spores will find their way back to the primary host to continue the life cycle. As a precaution, if you find the orange blobs you could sprinkle some sulphur dust on the leaves.
\n\nThe best defense is to keep the primary and secondary hosts separate. If you’re in the midst of planning your yard, consider leaving some distance between these varieties.
\n\nAs this is our third rainy spring, I consider this fungus well established. While you’ll see more of it on rainy years and less on dry years, it’s here to stay so the best offense you have is to learn how to identify it early and keep it off your deciduous trees."

User > Bug identification - N Portland: I recently found a small brown bug on my desk and was hoping you could help me identify it. It was brown, with a slightly darker underside and about 3.5mm long. I have both a dog and indoor cat. Could either of them have brought the bug in? Could it be harmful to them or me? What should I do to eradicate these bugs from my home?
