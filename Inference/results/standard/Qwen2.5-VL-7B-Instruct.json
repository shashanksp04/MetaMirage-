Can you identify and recommend a solution?\n\nadditional context: The symptoms you're describing—wilting and stems curling down—are indicative of several potential issues, including fungal diseases such as Tomato Wilt. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities first, such as overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiencies, or physical damage. Here’s how you might proceed:\n\n1. **Check Soil Conditions**: Ensure the soil is neither too wet nor too dry. Overwatering can cause root rot, while underwatering can lead to wilting. Check the moisture level by inserting a finger into the soil about an inch deep; it should feel moist but not soggy.\n\n2. **Inspect for Fungus**: Look closely at the base of the plants for any signs of fungal growth. Tomato Wilt is often associated with a white, cottony growth near the soil line. If you suspect Tomato Wilt, it's crucial to act quickly.\n\n3. **Nutrient Analysis**: Ensure the plants are receiving adequate nutrients. Lack of nitrogen can cause yellowing leaves and wilting.

{"id": "#789132", "question": "I fear my compost pile is infested with jumping worms. Hundreds of them. Now what should I do about the jumping worms?", "answer": "Jumping worms (such as Amynthas agrestis, Amynthas tokioensis, Metaphire hilgendorfi) are invasive earthworms known for producing uniform, granular castings that resemble coffee grounds. When disturbed, these worms thrash violently with snakelike movement, which distinguishes them from European nightcrawlers. Mature jumping worms have a white, fully encircling clitellum, which is different from the u-shaped clitellum of European garden worms.\n\nThese worms are problematic because they destroy the soil food web by rapidly consuming and eliminating the organic layer at the surface. If your compost pile is infested with hundreds of jumping worms, eradication is challenging, but there are management steps you can take:\n\n1. **Hot Composting:** Raise the temperature of your compost pile significantly. High heat helps kill both adult worms and their cocoons.\n\n2. **Solarization Treatment:** After removing compost from the bin, spread it into a shallow pile (6 to 8 inches deep) on top of clear plastic, making it 10 to 15 feet long and 4 to 8 feet wide. Cover with a clear plastic sheet and tuck in the edges to prevent worm escape. Leave the setup in full sun for 2 to 3 days to allow the temperature to rise above 150°F. This temperature is necessary to kill both adult worms and their cocoons.\n\n3. **Prevention of Spread:** Do not use unsolarized compost in your potting mixes or garden beds, as this risks spreading jumping worms. Only compost that has been heat-treated should be distributed.\n\nIn summary: Identify jumping worms by their distinctive movements, castings, and white clitellum; hot compost or solarize infested material to kill them; and take care not to spread unsanitized compost.

There is also a small hole underneath it that has developed a crack that has worked its way down the trunk. The tree is otherwise healthy. The only thing we can think of is that it might have been shot with a copper or lead pellet. Do you have any ideas about this Pin Oak mystery and is there something we can do to keep this tree?", "answer": "Your Pin Oak is exhibiting symptoms of slime flux (also known as wetwood), a common condition in oaks and several other tree species. This issue typically presents as dark, foul-smelling sap seeping from wounds, cracks, or cuts in the trunk or branches. The sap may be frothy and white at the point of exit and often turns gray or white upon drying. The appearance can be alarming, but generally does not indicate a serious threat to the overall health of a mature tree.\n\nSlime flux occurs when bacteria and yeast enter the tree through wounds caused by pruning, breakage, cracks, or other injuries. Once inside, these microorganisms live in the heartwood, producing gases that force sap to the surface. The bacteria are not true pathogens and usually do not cause further harm to the tree's live tissues. However, their activity can delay wound healing and sometimes weaken the wood structure.\n\nThis condition can appear after a tree is wounded (including by pruning or possible physical damage such as a pellet), as this provides an entry point for the bacteria. Inside affected limbs, the core wood often shows dark, water-soaked lesions, as seen in your photos.\n\nThere is no cure or direct treatment for slime flux. Old practices like installing drain tubes or boring additional holes are now discouraged, as they do more harm than good by increasing wood decay risk. To help your tree:\n- Avoid unnecessary wounding of the trunk and branches.\n- Use proper pruning techniques to promote rapid closure of any cuts.\n- Provide good general care, including adequate irrigation during drought and mulching to protect roots and conserve soil moisture.\n- Prevent further injury from lawnmowers or excessive foot traffic near the tree's base.\n\nMost trees with slime flux remain otherwise healthy and can live for many years. The best course is to minimize new wounds and monitor your tree’s condition.
